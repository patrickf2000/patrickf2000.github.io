<p>I spent a good part of today trying out different Linux distros on my lab machine, a Dell XPS desktop. Because I spent quite a bit of time on my computers (sometimes not entirely by choice...), when I need a change, switching my Linux distros is one of the best starting points. And even with that aside, knowing different distros is a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Linux Mint has consistently been my most used distro for the past six years. I tend to always come back to that. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, and has a very pretty, functional user interface. Its absolutely rock solid, and I like how the developers follow a "when-its-ready", but still regular enough release cycle.</p>
<p>However, I find that Linux Mint isn't always the best for development because the packages are often outdated. I mean, its usable for the vast majority of purposes, but there are times it becomes a real annoyance to me. For a while, I used Manjaro, which is also rather rock solid and very nice to use. It uses a rolling release cycle, which means you always have the latest packages. However, for reasons I will discuss below, I tend to use Fedora as my development distro. Fedora tends to have the latest packages, and is equally as rock solid and stable.</p>
<p>My Dell XPS, while being my lab machine, is also my archive and office machine. I have three drives, an M.2, an SSD, and a 1 TB regular hard drive. I really don't like using regular hard drives for development of any kind, and on second thoughts I didn't want to keep records and pictures on my laptop, so I use this to store stuff. The other two drives are development. So dual booting is an essential requirement (or is it tri-booting I guess...).</p>
<h3>OpenSUSE</h3>
<p>I've heard very good things about OpenSUSE, and I've used it a long time ago, though never in depth. I really wanted to try it, but I never got past the LiveCDs. One of them did boot and look really nice, but as a whole they gave me nothing but grief. The first time I tried it, it took <em>forever</em> to boot, and when it finally did, it was slow as hell. The other booted the first time, and looked rather nice, but for some reason never booted again.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I should have just installed it and tried it out, but the LiveCD experience was a significant turnoff.</p>
<h3>Solus</h3>
<p>Solus looks really, really nice. I like the Budgie desktop and the fact its rolling release. I did actually install it, only to find out that in EFI mode, it doesn't use Grub (and there's no option as far as I'm aware to enable it). I have a rule that Linux Mint is the booting distro, so if it doesn't work from Linux Mint, its out.</p>
<p>Its too bad. Solus looks very promising. Maybe I'll try it on my laptop...</p>
<h3>ElementaryOS</h3>
<p>I didn't do this on my desktop, but I installed it earlier in the week on my laptop. I have to say I really love this.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways its similar to Linux Mint in that its based on Ubuntu with its own desktop environment. As a result, it looks really nice and is stable and compatible with most stuff. The downsides are the same though: older packages. With ElementaryOS, I'm not sure of their release cycle yet, it follows the "when-ready" approach which I think is good, but it there doesn't seem to be a pattern. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully they get the Ubuntu 20 -based version before long.</p>
<p>ElementaryOS by design looks and feels like MacOS, which is a nice change for someone who generally lives by Windows-like interfaces.</p>
<h3>Manjaro</h3>
<p>I've used Manjaro many times in the past, and I <em>love</em> it. Its based on Arch Linux, and therefore follows the rolling-release model. Its seems more bleeding-edge than Solus, but I've never had any stability issues with it (at the same time though, I would never use it as my archive OS). I've never used it much on my desktop, but quite a lot on the laptop. Manjaro is really fast, and comes with the widest selection of desktops I've seen.</p>
<p>The problem is that it won't boot from the Linux Mint bootloader; it just hangs. At some point I may break down and just have to use it, but for now that is a sufficient annoyance for me not to use it.</p>
<h3>GhostBSD and FreeBSD</h3>
<p>I know, I know, this isn't Linux. I've always been intrigued with the other non-Unix systems, and BSD is no exception. The only problem is that I have yet to own a machine it actually works on.</p>
<p>When I say "actually works", its always booted and installed on the machines I've had, but there's always a network driver or graphics error that requires more sysadmin skills than I honestly have the patience for. At the end of the day, I'm programmer and like working with interesting problems, and sysadmin is neither. That's why I use these beginner distros like Linux Mint: they just work. I've actually had more luck with Solaris than the BSDs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This wasn't meant to be all negative. As you can see, two hits (Solus and ElementaryOS), two flops (*BSD and OpenSUSE), and one kind of both (Manjaro). For now I'm probably going to just stick to Fedora. I don't love how Fedora is a short-term point release, but its rock solid, everything works with it, and its recent enough to be a good development tool.</p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="/category/linux.html">Linux</a>

<p>I've been a loyal Linux user for almost six years now. Really longer if you count the Kindle... Anyway. Maybe loyal isn't the greatest word to use. I use Linux because I like, because I think its a superior platform in many ways, and over the past year, because of â€¦</p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="/category/linux.html">Linux</a>
