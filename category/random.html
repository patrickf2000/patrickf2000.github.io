                <p>I heard a while back from a friend that a Raspberry Pi can be used as a router. I never really thought about it until last December, when I was trying to find a more useful anti-distraction method than my browser blocker (it was too easy to get around). I found some guides on how you can use a Raspberry Pi to create a wireless access point within your home network, and from there install a DNS blackhole which can be used to block a lot of things.</p>
<p>I originally set things up and ran it on a Rasberry Pi 3B+, and it ran for the last 15 days or so of December. Then at the beginning of the year, I took it down and moved everything over to a Raspberry Pi 4. As of today, the Pi 4 has been happily running without a reboot for 28 days (which is now my personal record for the longest uptime of any computer).</p>
<p>Here's it running:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/rpi.jpg"></p>
<p>An anti-distraction mechanism? Doesn't that seem like an extreme method?</p>
<p>Yes. But its worth it. Even though I love what I do, its just too easy to get distracted when you're researching things. And it can become damaging if you let it happen unchecked too often. If you don't believe me, read <em>The Shallows</em> by Nicholas Carr.</p>
<p>But seriously though, its super easy to set up, even for a non-technical person, and it actually works. I can safely say this because system and network administration is not one of my strong points in computer science. The DNS blackhole I talked about is called Pi-Hole. Its actually used to block advertistements, but because of how it functions, its equally as well suited as a site blocker. And as far as speed goes, I really don't notice a difference from my home network. Downloads are slightly slower, but its not huge. Uploads aren't bad at all. I have Zoom meetings regularly with it, and again, no issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I have instructions on my site for setting it up: <a href="/howto/rpi-router.html">Raspberry Pi Router</a></p>

                <p>I drive a 2002 Ford Ranger, and I have been for over a year now (I bought it back in summer 2019). </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/ranger.jpg"></p>
<p>Rangers are great cars for people who like to drive trucks but don't want something huge. One of my few gripes with it was the radio system. It wasn't completely awful- it was actually an upgrade from my first car, a 2001 Ford Expedition (it was actually my dad's). Because of the Expedition, I've never been able to use my phone- I use CDs. But even though the Ranger can play more CDs, it struggles to actually play them.</p>
<p>So, for my birthday, I got an upgrade. And I tried to install it myself, and I got as far as getting the old one out:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/radio-attempt.jpg"></p>
<p>Being the mechanical genius I am, it never occurred to me that you needed an adaptor for the connectors. I don't know, I thought they were all the same... But it turned out that Best Buy where my dad bought the radio had free installation, so I went there yesterday and had someone who knew what they were doing install it.</p>
<p>And its <em>awesome</em>. In addition to CDs and radio, it has Bluetooth, AUX plugin, and a USB charger. And because the radio was a little small, they used a mounting kit, so there's a little slot below, which will be nice for storing things... Just look below :)</p>

                <p>So I was cleaning house earlier... Or rather, cleaning the computer. You know, when there gets to be a million things on your desktop? Anyway.</p>
<p>I have a small collection of vintage operating systems, some of which I've been able to get running in virtual machines. When I say vintage, I don't necessarily mean the ones everyone has heard about; there's a few obscure you may never have heard of. But anyway, I forgot I had screenshots of them because they are with the OSes and not the rest of my pictures. I only have three OSes photographed at the moment, but they are worth seeing.</p>
<h2>IBM OS/2</h2>
<p>The only truly vintage one here. The history behind this operating system is interesting. It runs without any issues in Virtualbox, but as I remember it was a little tricky to get running. I lost the article, but if I ever decide to run it again, I'll be sure to post.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/os2.png"></p>
<h2>Sky OS</h2>
<p>Sky OS was a fairly complete operating system written mainly by Robert Szeleney from 1997 until 2009. It was a Unix-like OS with a graphical desktop, and even got to the point of being able to run real applications such as the GNU Toolchain and Firefox. The OS was meant to be a commerical product, but it never aquired a sufficient developer/user base, and eventually, Szeleney couldn't keep up with development. You can still find disk images and a key and boot it up in Virtualbox. Its a rather nice OS, its a shame it never went further.</p>
<p>The desktop:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/skyos1.png"></p>
<p>Some applications running:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/skyos2.png"></p>
<h2>Syllable OS</h2>
<p>Another free OS from the early 2000s. Unlike Sky OS, Syllable was actually open source. It eventually stagnated and development ended in 2012. There wasn't a huge team behind this one either, and it got really far in terms of capabilities. Its a shame neither this nor Sky OS ever became viable alternatives to Windows because they really had potential.</p>
<p>The desktop:</p>

                <p>As much as I love programming, when one is on the computer all day for work and school, your desire to get off the computer begins to outweigh that. My parents have an old Samsung printer, but after many years of heavy use it began to jam when pulling up paper. It turns out the issue is this little part rather deep inside can get warn out and begin to stick, which is why it sucks up all that paper. When I say deep inside, I literally mean that. You have to take apart a lot to get to that issue. I should have taken a better shot, but here's what it looks like halfway through the process (that's the computer board).</p>
<p>It still doesn't work perfectly, put it can get through about 15 sheets before it jams. Oh well, that's fine, they never print more than maybe 5 at a time (and that's stretching it). </p>
<p>I can't take credit for figuring it out, but I'm proud I got it fixed. Its always cool when you're able to fix something. If anyone has a Samsung SCX-4623FW jamming, here's an excellent link: <a href="https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/">https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/</a>.</p>

                <p>I will be honest, I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, other than for like one or two songs. I think that's changing. On a completely unrelated search, I came across her new album, <em>Folklore</em>. I want to say its probably one of the best new albums I've heard in a while (other than Coldplay's <em>Everyday Life</em>, which is a close race). I think the overall feel is very appropriate for the times.</p>
<p>I was going through the songs on Youtube, and someone left a comment basically said "She wrote the whole album in quarantine, and I can't even finish a puzzle." Kind of a thought provoking honestly...</p>
<p>These are the best songs in my opinion: <br>
