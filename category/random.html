                <p>So I was cleaning house earlier... Or rather, cleaning the computer. You know, when there gets to be a million things on your desktop? Anyway.</p>
<p>I have a small collection of vintage operating systems, some of which I've been able to get running in virtual machines. When I say vintage, I don't necessarily mean the ones everyone has heard about; there's a few obscure you may never have heard of. But anyway, I forgot I had screenshots of them because they are with the OSes and not the rest of my pictures. I only have three OSes photographed at the moment, but they are worth seeing.</p>
<h2>IBM OS/2</h2>
<p>The only truly vintage one here. The history behind this operating system is interesting. It runs without any issues in Virtualbox, but as I remember it was a little tricky to get running. I lost the article, but if I ever decide to run it again, I'll be sure to post.</p>

<h2>Sky OS</h2>
<p>Sky OS was a fairly complete operating system written mainly by Robert Szeleney from 1997 until 2009. It was a Unix-like OS with a graphical desktop, and even got to the point of being able to run real applications such as the GNU Toolchain and Firefox. The OS was meant to be a commerical product, but it never aquired a sufficient developer/user base, and eventually, Szeleney couldn't keep up with development. You can still find disk images and a key and boot it up in Virtualbox. Its a rather nice OS, its a shame it never went further.</p>
<p>The desktop:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/skyos1.png"></p>
<p>Some applications running:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/skyos2.png"></p>
<h2>Syllable OS</h2>
<p>Another free OS from the early 2000s. Unlike Sky OS, Syllable was actually open source. It eventually stagnated and development ended in 2012. There wasn't a huge team behind this one either, and it got really far in terms of capabilities. Its a shame neither this nor Sky OS ever became viable alternatives to Windows because they really had potential.</p>

                <p>As much as I love programming, when one is on the computer all day for work and school, your desire to get off the computer begins to outweigh that. My parents have an old Samsung printer, but after many years of heavy use it began to jam when pulling up paper. It turns out the issue is this little part rather deep inside can get warn out and begin to stick, which is why it sucks up all that paper. When I say deep inside, I literally mean that. You have to take apart a lot to get to that issue. I should have taken a better shot, but here's what it looks like halfway through the process (that's the computer board).</p>
<p>It still doesn't work perfectly, put it can get through about 15 sheets before it jams. Oh well, that's fine, they never print more than maybe 5 at a time (and that's stretching it). </p>
<p>I can't take credit for figuring it out, but I'm proud I got it fixed. Its always cool when you're able to fix something. If anyone has a Samsung SCX-4623FW jamming, here's an excellent link: <a href="https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/">https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/</a>.</p>

                <p>I will be honest, I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, other than for like one or two songs. I think that's changing. On a completely unrelated search, I came across her new album, <em>Folklore</em>. I want to say its probably one of the best new albums I've heard in a while (other than Coldplay's <em>Everyday Life</em>, which is a close race). I think the overall feel is very appropriate for the times.</p>
<p>I was going through the songs on Youtube, and someone left a comment basically said "She wrote the whole album in quarantine, and I can't even finish a puzzle." Kind of a thought provoking honestly...</p>
<p>These are the best songs in my opinion: <br>

                <p>I know you're thinking, what an interesting title. This post is actually a few days overdue, I just haven't had the chance till now.</p>
<p>You may have seen the news story on Sunday about the 5.1 magnitude earthquake in North Carolina. I forget exactly where it was, but we felt it here in Charlotte. This being the largest earthquake I've felt, it was kind of wierd and interesting at the same time. We were eating breakfast, and the house just started shaking and creaking and we could feel the floor moving (we don't have a basement by the way). Compared to people who live in more earthquake-prone areas, it wasn't much, but for me interesting nonetheless. First earthquake...</p>
<p>Even if I can't personally give Charlotte a whole lot, for some reasons out of all the places I've lived this area seems to have the most and best rainbows. I've got a collection of them, with the one below being the most recent. Apologies if the quality is bad... My phone really is quite cheap, and my windows are dirty.</p>

                <p>So we are on the second day of no internet… We’re hoping to get it back in a few hours, but if not, it won’t be until Saturday. I’ve been trying to get my life to the point where not having internet is an inconvenience rather than a tragedy. Right now, its close to that because of my job.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this morning working on bug-fixing the text editor I use for job and personal projects. This particular editor uses C++ and Qt. Usually I use the Qt online docs- which are super nice- but obviously I couldn’t use them. There is another solution for C and C++ users to develop offline.</p>
<p>If you are a C or C++ developer, you can skip this paragraph. If not, you should read it. Many modern programming languages use the concept of modules for libraries and larger projects. And this is nice, but it has a slight downside. Oftentimes, the module is the translation unit, so the logic and the definitions are in the entire file. In C/C++, a project consists of header files and source files. Header files contain function declarations- and good header files have comment blocks that contain the documentation for that function (glibc comes to mind…). This is really nice because you can theoretically use these in place of online documentation when you are working with a library.</p>
<p>So that’s what I did. I picked through my system and found all the Qt header files, and was able to get all my bugs I had listed fixed up. It was a slight pain browsing through the headers, but it actually wasn’t too bad since I had been using Qt for years- I pretty much knew which files to look in. And my bugs really weren’t anything huge anyway.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer, I have a lot of documents, references, and specs (and I have them copied over to my dev machine as well). After years of bad internet, I have learned that this is a really helpful thing to do. Now if you are a web developer you may be out of luck, but if you do systems-related stuff, doing this is really helpful. If you are on Linux, I also urge you to learn to use the manual system (the “man” command).</p>
<p>Just a thought... </p>
