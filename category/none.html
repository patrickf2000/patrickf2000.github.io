                <p>Once again it's been a while… I didn’t realize I had let my blog go through May without an update. Oh well. It's been busy the past month with life and personal stuff, some of which I’ll share.</p>
<h3>Another School Year…</h3>
<p>Another school year has come and gone. I just finished my junior year, which means I have only one more year left of undergraduate. I think I could have finished a semester early, but I wanted to focus on my internship, and there really isn’t a need. I need some extra credits anyway, so I decided to enroll in French 1 and 2 for my final year.</p>
<p>It’s kind of surreal in a way to be done with yet another year. And to make it even more surreal, almost half my college time has been online thanks to covid (online degree… lol). Academically it’s been nice- as far as grades go, this has been my best year. Everything is coming back to normal, which I’m looking forward to.</p>
<h3>A New Job</h3>
<p>If you’ve seen my resume, last year I worked for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I really enjoyed the whole lab experience, so I decided to do the same again this year. However, for various reasons, I switched labs, this time going to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (yep, the place where they built the atomic bomb). It’s only week three, but so far it’s been an enjoyable experience. I am doing some work on the LANL fork of Clang/LLVM, which is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Like anyone in the compiler field, I’ve been familar with LLVM, but being the type of person that likes to torture myself (using a very good friend’s words here), I always wrote my compilers completely from scratch- frontend and backend. And I do really like writing backends. However, after working with LLVM, I want to say it’s so awesome.</p>
<h3>New Projects</h3>
<p>Because I haven’t received the covid vaccine yet, I still have sufficient time to do some fun side projects. In the past few months, I’ve been making an effort to break out of the programming space and explore other areas. Don’t get me wrong, I love programming, but it's good and healthy to have a variety of hobbies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have started on yet another compiler project. It's not public yet since it's in the early stages, but it is past that initial point where it will either become a project or get abandoned. It’s a new compiler written in C++ to help me learn LLVM, partly for my job and partly because I really like it. At the moment, it’s a rewrite of the Ida compiler I spent the tail end of last year working on. So far, it’s going really well. I still wrote the frontend from scratch, and I would like to say it has my best expression parser yet.</p>
<p>As for my non-programming projects, my main things have been reading, languages, and some writing. The reading honestly has been self-help stuff lately, but still, it’s been good reading. I’ll come back to that in another post. The languages have taken two forms. Because I’m taking French this fall, I’ve been working to get a start on that over the summer. It's been really enjoyable. Learning Esperanto at the beginning of the year was helpful. The second form, being the nerd that I am, I’ve been exploring constructed languages. I created a simple one, and I’m working on the second version now. Finally, with writing, I’m still trying to keep this site up, and I started doing some creative writing as well.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have some outlines down for more things to write about, so hopefully I’ll be able to keep this site up through the coming months. There will still be plenty of tech, but I will probably start branching out into other areas. Stay tuned!</p>

                <p>It has been a while since I hosted here. Honestly, its been a while since much of anything post-worthy has happened. I've been busy with school and my spring semester job, so the time of interesting side projects has been small. Not to mention a number of personal things... But the semester is slowing down, and I've been working on some new things.</p>
<h2>Ida</h2>
<p>First bit of news, my Lila language got renamed to Ida. There were personal reasons behind this, but also some more technical reasons, as well as based on future thoughts. I've kind of shelved the project for the time being.</p>
<p>For those of you who may be curious, here is why: I dove into compilers back in fall of 2019, and let me be clear, I <em>love</em> this field. However, I've been doing compiler project after compiler project almost constantly since this time, and I'm trying to find some different things to try my hand on. Additionally, I'm getting ready to start a job that will allow me to utilize my compiler knowledge, so I'm not sure how beneficial it will be for me to do compilers as a day job, then something else on the side. Maybe it is, but I want a different challenge to play with. Therefore, I'm shelving my compilers for the time being, and working on other projects, which I will publish in due time.</p>
<h2>CppEditor</h2>
<p>CppEditor got a few updates. Mainly it was some needed fixes, but I also added a feature where it will help you match opening and closing brackets/braces/etc for certain languages. For those of you who don't love this feature, you have the option of disabling.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>No, I'm not talking about programming languages. I'm talking about real languages. One of my goals for a long time has been to learn a foreign language. Because I have a light senior year, I'm going to try my hand at French. In the meantime, I'm trying to get a little bit of a start by learning and practicing some each day.</p>
<p>I'm also working on learning Esperanto. In the near future, I plan to write a more detailed post on Esperanto, but for those of you who don't know what it is, it is a constructed international auxiliary language. The grammar is extremely easy, and once you have that down, picking up the words is relatively straightforward, especially if your native language is a European language (which includes English). Learning Esperanto is supposed to help you once you learn another language, and besides, the ideas behind it are really cool.</p>
<h2>Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>I've been kind of on a self-improvement binge lately. Or maybe I shouldn't call it a binge, its more like a journey (because anyone who thinks it isn't clearly hasn't done it...). The main element to this is fitness, but I've also been trying a few other things like meditation. I've also been experimenting with some new daily schedules and planning tools. I'll have to write about some of this.</p>
<p>Keeping up with this site is one of my goals, and hopefully I'll be able to. Stay tuned!</p>

                <p>This site has been kind of quiet lately. I've been trying to keep up with it, but August and September thus far has been kind of busy. I've been wrapping up my internship at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and I'm transitioning back into my job as a research assistant. I'm really happy with how the internship went, and this semester looks like it will be exciting as far as research goes.</p>
<p>Its probably been about a month- maybe two actually- but I pushed a new project to my GitHub page: Asmx86. I know it may be hard to tell from the name, but its an assembler for the x86-64 platform. This honestly is one of my favorite projects, moreso because its been a long time coming. I've been wanting to write an assembler for a while, and I've tried a few times, but this is the first time its actually worked. Compared to compilers, assemblers are much easier (there's a 1:1 translation between the source and the target), but in many ways its harder because it requires a deep knowledge of the architecture you're targeting. Additionally, if you want to make something useful, you have to generate code in your operating system's executable format (in my case, its ELF).</p>
<p>I wrote Asmx86 in C and used Flex and Bison for the parser. Everything else I wrote myself. Generating ELF was easy- I just used the structures in /usr/include/elf.h and wrote this to the binary file (which is easy to do in C). Getting all the different ELF parts and calculating the offsets and everything was challenging. I also had issues getting my string tables to work; I've been spoiled by C++'s string and vector classes. The result has been well worth it. My assembler can generate fully working and linkable ELF objects, which you can link into an executable, a static library, a dynamic library, or objects from a C compiler. I've tested linking with the C standard library and the start-up object files, and everything seems to be working, which is super exciting. Obviously the entire x86 instruction is not supported, but enough is working for non-trivial programs (adding new instructions is easy).</p>
<p>I'll have to write more about the entire learning process later. As far as side projects go, I recently started a re-implementation of Quik using the Rust programming language. So far its off to a good start; I have a goal of targeting multiple architectures. On the x86 side, I'll be using my custom assembler.</p>
<p>As part of that project (and for other reasons as well), I finally upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 4. I have a Pi 3, but I've been having a hard time getting into the whole hobby electronics thing (partly because I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing), so I started using it to learn the Arm architecture. The problem is that its too slow, and its only usable if you use the 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS. So, I got the Pi 4 with 4gb of RAM, and its been really nice. I've started on the code generation for Arm64 in the new Quik compiler. More on this later.</p>

                <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>So I decided I'm going to give blogging a try... Make that my social media I guess. I've tried it before, but things never really took off- I think I was trying too hard. Not to mention that blogs can be expensive. I got around that by using Pelican to generate my blog, and surge.sh to host the site. All this for free. All I paid for is the domain which I think was like $10. Anyway, I'm going to make this like a journal, then maybe I'll actually write.</p>
<p>I am rare among people of my generation because I don't use social media. And to add further irony, I am a computer scientist, and enjoy programming in my free time. Yeah, strange. Okay, I actually did have social media for a brief period, but I never could get into it. I got into it more, it made my life miserable, and I deleted all of it three months later. I'll have to write more about this another time. I kind of want this blog to replace that.</p>
<p>We'll see how it goes... Even if its a journal I can look back upon I'll be happy with it.</p>
