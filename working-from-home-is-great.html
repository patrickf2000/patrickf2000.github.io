                <p>… until the internet goes down. Okay, maybe in ordinary times it wouldn’t be so bad, but in covid-19 days, its a different story. </p>
<p>The internet is a constant frustration around here for us. We live out, though not technically in the country. Its more like the outer-outer suburbs of Charlotte, in one of the newly-developing areas. You think that in an area that’s almost all new-construction, the internet would be built to work properly. Not so. We have brief dips several times a week, we usually have to restart the router every couple weeks or so, and every now and then, it will give up, crash, and go out completely. </p>
<p>It sometimes frustrates me how dependent we have become on the internet in such a short time, especially for our jobs. I’m not necessarily against it, but more often than not, I think we are over-dependent. In recent months to curb time I spend (or I should say, waste) online, I’ve been making a point to download and save things like technical documents to my computers so when I program, I can just reference those rather than going on Google binge. This is all well and good for some projects, but when you have a job that is a web application using remote resources, its a different story.</p>
<p>Okay enough ranting. </p>
