                <p>This site has been kind of quiet lately. I've been trying to keep up with it, but August and September thus far has been kind of busy. I've been wrapping up my internship at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and I'm transitioning back into my job as a research assistant. I'm really happy with how the internship went, and this semester looks like it will be exciting as far as research goes.</p>
<p>Its probably been about a month- maybe two actually- but I pushed a new project to my GitHub page: Asmx86. I know it may be hard to tell from the name, but its an assembler for the x86-64 platform. This honestly is one of my favorite projects, moreso because its been a long time coming. I've been wanting to write an assembler for a while, and I've tried a few times, but this is the first time its actually worked. Compared to compilers, assemblers are much easier (there's a 1:1 translation between the source and the target), but in many ways its harder because it requires a deep knowledge of the architecture you're targeting. Additionally, if you want to make something useful, you have to generate code in your operating system's executable format (in my case, its ELF).</p>
<p>I wrote Asmx86 in C and used Flex and Bison for the parser. Everything else I wrote myself. Generating ELF was easy- I just used the structures in /usr/include/elf.h and wrote this to the binary file (which is easy to do in C). Getting all the different ELF parts and calculating the offsets and everything was challenging. I also had issues getting my string tables to work; I've been spoiled by C++'s string and vector classes. The result has been well worth it. My assembler can generate fully working and linkable ELF objects, which you can link into an executable, a static library, a dynamic library, or objects from a C compiler. I've tested linking with the C standard library and the start-up object files, and everything seems to be working, which is super exciting. Obviously the entire x86 instruction is not supported, but enough is working for non-trivial programs (adding new instructions is easy).</p>
<p>I'll have to write more about the entire learning process later. As far as side projects go, I recently started a re-implementation of Quik using the Rust programming language. So far its off to a good start; I have a goal of targeting multiple architectures. On the x86 side, I'll be using my custom assembler.</p>
<p>As part of that project (and for other reasons as well), I finally upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 4. I have a Pi 3, but I've been having a hard time getting into the whole hobby electronics thing (partly because I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing), so I started using it to learn the Arm architecture. The problem is that its too slow, and its only usable if you use the 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS. So, I got the Pi 4 with 4gb of RAM, and its been really nice. I've started on the code generation for Arm64 in the new Quik compiler. More on this later.</p>

                <p>I will be honest, I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, other than for like one or two songs. I think that's changing. On a completely unrelated search, I came across her new album, <em>Folklore</em>. I want to say its probably one of the best new albums I've heard in a while (other than Coldplay's <em>Everyday Life</em>, which is a close race). I think the overall feel is very appropriate for the times.</p>
<p>I was going through the songs on Youtube, and someone left a comment basically said "She wrote the whole album in quarantine, and I can't even finish a puzzle." Kind of a thought provoking honestly...</p>
<p>These are the best songs in my opinion: <br>

                <p>I know you're thinking, what an interesting title. This post is actually a few days overdue, I just haven't had the chance till now.</p>
<p>You may have seen the news story on Sunday about the 5.1 magnitude earthquake in North Carolina. I forget exactly where it was, but we felt it here in Charlotte. This being the largest earthquake I've felt, it was kind of wierd and interesting at the same time. We were eating breakfast, and the house just started shaking and creaking and we could feel the floor moving (we don't have a basement by the way). Compared to people who live in more earthquake-prone areas, it wasn't much, but for me interesting nonetheless. First earthquake...</p>
<p>Even if I can't personally give Charlotte a whole lot, for some reasons out of all the places I've lived this area seems to have the most and best rainbows. I've got a collection of them, with the one below being the most recent. Apologies if the quality is bad... My phone really is quite cheap, and my windows are dirty.</p>

                <p>Static sites are somewhat of a new thing for me. I wrote about this a little bit a few weeks ago, but I'm going to write more primarily as guidance for others interested in inexpensive blogging.</p>
<p>Back when I was originally trying to blog, I was using Wordpress (like everyone else...). Don't get me wrong, I love Wordpress, but the reason I stopped was money. I originally had hosting for my first year, but when it renewed it went up a lot from what it originally was. Now granted, it was probably my fault since I'm sure it was spelled out and I just didn't read it. Regardless, it pretty much came down to paying a lot for decent hosting or cheaping out and hopefully getting something decent- if I wanted to keep Wordpress.</p>
<p>That's why I'm now doing static hosting. I'm using Pelican as my content generator, and its actually quite nice once you learn how to use it. Hosting was more of a challenge. Originally, I was using surge.sh, which is really nice until it you get to custom domains. Custom domains are free, but HTTPS is not. I tried it, but my wake-up call came yesterday when I switched desktop computers and Firefox gave me all kind of certificate warnings about the site which rightly would scare people off. So, I decided to switch.</p>
<p>A slight downside to static blogging is unlike Wordpress, you are responsible for the posts and making sure they get backed up and saved. Using Git is a really good solution for this. Not that it matters, I kind of preferred to keep this stuff in a private repository, which meant I kept it on Gitlab (I have Github and Gitlab accounts- Github for the important public stuff, and Gitlab for my smaller private stuff). This is where the static hosting comes in. Github and Gitlab both have a static site feature- basically, you can create a free static site based from your repository. I've personally found Gitlab to be a lot nicer. You can create your website from a private repository and it seems to offer a higher level of configuration (all based on the free plan by the way). Now granted, I didn't look into Github much deeper after I noticed you can create the site from a private repo in Gitlab, but you cannot in Github. Setup was really easy, as was pointing my custom domain to it.</p>
<p>Even if you're not overly technical, learning just enough Git to do this is easy. If you are, it should be no trouble at all. As far as cost goes- which is a big benefit to static hosting- all I paid for was my domain name which was like $10 I think. If you're a blogger on a budget, this is something to think about.</p>

<p>I thought this is post worthy. I'll admit this is a little hard to see, but it shouldn't be too bad.</p>
<p>I've been programming compilers for almost a year now. I have three or four published on Github- two Quik compilers and my extcc compiler. I've also made several other programs that would fall into the general compiler category, including a very basic Java class generator, a pseudo-assembly layer, and two simple assemblers- one written in Haskell that doesn't do too much, and another written in C that does a lot more, but I haven't published yet. Quik is a simple BASIC-like language I devised primarily to learn compilers. The benefit of learning with Quik was that its easy to parse. And then there's the element of creating your own language.</p>
<p>Quik went through a couple iterations mainly because I didn't know what I was doing at first. Extcc was a fork of the latest version of Quik that eventually became primarily a C compiler. I took a break from my compilers after I got a little tired of extcc, but lately I've picked it up again by starting a new project. Once again, its a custom language but not Quik (though it resembles Quik). I'm not going to say too much since I haven't published the project and its still in its very early stages. The main purpose of this post is that graph above.</p>
<p>So far, this project has seen two big changes. First, Flex and Bison are used instead of handwritten parsers and scanners (I currently have different priorities). The second is I'm using Graphviz Dot to visualize my abstract syntax tree. Originally, to debug my AST I printed it out in the console. Seriously. If you take a look at the graph, you will notice that it starts with the file, the global scope, and the functions. In my original visualizers, I would simply print the node type, its main arguments (in the case of functions, the function name and return type), and then any children. To make it readable, I did indent, and the indentation was increased recursively on each iteration.</p>
<p>I knew about Dot graphs for a while, but I was exposed to them recently in my job. My boss was using them to debug a build tool that had to (among other things) recursively determine dependencies, determine the build order, and schedule each part. When I saw the graphs and the code, it clicked that this would be a far superior way for me to debug my AST's. And so I did. My new structure still uses a base AstNode (see either extcc or my latest Quik for an example), and other types are derived from it. The key difference is that each node has a <code>writeDot</code> function, which generates a portion of the Dot file. To generate the file, I only call the <code>writeDot</code> in the top node, and then it calls <code>writeDot</code> on all its children.</p>
<p>I'll write more about this later, especially if the project matures.</p>
