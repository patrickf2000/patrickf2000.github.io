                <p>I know you're thinking, what an interesting title. This post is actually a few days overdue, I just haven't had the chance till now.</p>
<p>You may have seen the news story on Sunday about the 5.1 magnitude earthquake in North Carolina. I forget exactly where it was, but we felt it here in Charlotte. This being the largest earthquake I've felt, it was kind of wierd and interesting at the same time. We were eating breakfast, and the house just started shaking and creaking and we could feel the floor moving (we don't have a basement by the way). Compared to people who live in more earthquake-prone areas, it wasn't much, but for me interesting nonetheless. First earthquake...</p>
<p>Even if I can't personally give Charlotte a whole lot, for some reasons out of all the places I've lived this area seems to have the most and best rainbows. I've got a collection of them, with the one below being the most recent. Apologies if the quality is bad... My phone really is quite cheap, and my windows are dirty.</p>

                <p>Static sites are somewhat of a new thing for me. I wrote about this a little bit a few weeks ago, but I'm going to write more primarily as guidance for others interested in inexpensive blogging.</p>
<p>Back when I was originally trying to blog, I was using Wordpress (like everyone else...). Don't get me wrong, I love Wordpress, but the reason I stopped was money. I originally had hosting for my first year, but when it renewed it went up a lot from what it originally was. Now granted, it was probably my fault since I'm sure it was spelled out and I just didn't read it. Regardless, it pretty much came down to paying a lot for decent hosting or cheaping out and hopefully getting something decent- if I wanted to keep Wordpress.</p>
<p>That's why I'm now doing static hosting. I'm using Pelican as my content generator, and its actually quite nice once you learn how to use it. Hosting was more of a challenge. Originally, I was using surge.sh, which is really nice until it you get to custom domains. Custom domains are free, but HTTPS is not. I tried it, but my wake-up call came yesterday when I switched desktop computers and Firefox gave me all kind of certificate warnings about the site which rightly would scare people off. So, I decided to switch.</p>
<p>A slight downside to static blogging is unlike Wordpress, you are responsible for the posts and making sure they get backed up and saved. Using Git is a really good solution for this. Not that it matters, I kind of preferred to keep this stuff in a private repository, which meant I kept it on Gitlab (I have Github and Gitlab accounts- Github for the important public stuff, and Gitlab for my smaller private stuff). This is where the static hosting comes in. Github and Gitlab both have a static site feature- basically, you can create a free static site based from your repository. I've personally found Gitlab to be a lot nicer. You can create your website from a private repository and it seems to offer a higher level of configuration (all based on the free plan by the way). Now granted, I didn't look into Github much deeper after I noticed you can create the site from a private repo in Gitlab, but you cannot in Github. Setup was really easy, as was pointing my custom domain to it.</p>
<p>Even if you're not overly technical, learning just enough Git to do this is easy. If you are, it should be no trouble at all. As far as cost goes- which is a big benefit to static hosting- all I paid for was my domain name which was like $10 I think. If you're a blogger on a budget, this is something to think about.</p>

<p>I thought this is post worthy. I'll admit this is a little hard to see, but it shouldn't be too bad.</p>
<p>I've been programming compilers for almost a year now. I have three or four published on Github- two Quik compilers and my extcc compiler. I've also made several other programs that would fall into the general compiler category, including a very basic Java class generator, a pseudo-assembly layer, and two simple assemblers- one written in Haskell that doesn't do too much, and another written in C that does a lot more, but I haven't published yet. Quik is a simple BASIC-like language I devised primarily to learn compilers. The benefit of learning with Quik was that its easy to parse. And then there's the element of creating your own language.</p>
<p>Quik went through a couple iterations mainly because I didn't know what I was doing at first. Extcc was a fork of the latest version of Quik that eventually became primarily a C compiler. I took a break from my compilers after I got a little tired of extcc, but lately I've picked it up again by starting a new project. Once again, its a custom language but not Quik (though it resembles Quik). I'm not going to say too much since I haven't published the project and its still in its very early stages. The main purpose of this post is that graph above.</p>
<p>So far, this project has seen two big changes. First, Flex and Bison are used instead of handwritten parsers and scanners (I currently have different priorities). The second is I'm using Graphviz Dot to visualize my abstract syntax tree. Originally, to debug my AST I printed it out in the console. Seriously. If you take a look at the graph, you will notice that it starts with the file, the global scope, and the functions. In my original visualizers, I would simply print the node type, its main arguments (in the case of functions, the function name and return type), and then any children. To make it readable, I did indent, and the indentation was increased recursively on each iteration.</p>
<p>I knew about Dot graphs for a while, but I was exposed to them recently in my job. My boss was using them to debug a build tool that had to (among other things) recursively determine dependencies, determine the build order, and schedule each part. When I saw the graphs and the code, it clicked that this would be a far superior way for me to debug my AST's. And so I did. My new structure still uses a base AstNode (see either extcc or my latest Quik for an example), and other types are derived from it. The key difference is that each node has a <code>writeDot</code> function, which generates a portion of the Dot file. To generate the file, I only call the <code>writeDot</code> in the top node, and then it calls <code>writeDot</code> on all its children.</p>
<p>I'll write more about this later, especially if the project matures.</p>

                <p>So if you've read below, you will remember how I was talking about our internet completely going out. To follow up on that story, basically here's what happened. The router/modem setup they gave us completely went out (I believe it was some all-in-one kind of thing, but I'm not sure). The service people told us they had cancellations and would send someone out that evening, but it never happened, so we ended up going to a store owned by our ISP and they gave us a whole new router- and told us they stopped using what we had before because they went out a lot. Surprise.</p>
<p>We set everything up, and the new system actually works pretty well- much better than the old actually. While I didn't arc towards complete dislike, my liking went down significantly when I found out the only way to change the router settings was through the ISP's mobile app. Even if you took out the fact that I live with my dad- so obviously he is the ISP customer- the fact that you have to have an app is (in my opinion) completely stupid.</p>
<p>I generally love technology until we get to the consumer side, and even the consumer side doesn't bother me much until we hit the mobile arena. There definitely seems to be a sentiment that we need an app for everything- I guess it makes sense, phones are basically our companions- we are on them all the time, so why not just make an app? In some cases, maybe so. But an app to manage your router? Seriously?</p>
<p>The logic behind using smartphones for things like this, as well as others such as two-factor authentication, payments, and so forth is that most people always have their phone with them- and that makes it secure and verifies identity. To an extent, I think that's true. But a phone is a small device, easily lost or stolen. And unless you have multiple mobile devices, it creates a single point of failure. This is exactly why I don't use two-factor authentication, or any service that I can't also use on my computers. Consider two factor authentication. I only use it for one thing, and that's only because I have no choice. I have many accounts that I could use with two factor authentication, but choose not too. Why? Because I don't want that single point of failure. If I lose my phone, or if it gets stolen, true it would be difficult for someone to get in, but the fact that its gone will make it hard for me to get back into my accounts. I am not opposed to using my phone as a secondary form of verification (ie, those text messages with a code), but I will not allow it to be the deciding factor regarding whether I get into my accounts.</p>
<p>This goes back to my router- once you are solely dependent on one device, you are creating a single point of failure. If I have a real need to get into my router, I can't unless I get my dad to let me in (I have actually needed to for my job- long story). And if something happened to his phone, that creates a single point of failure for him.</p>
<p>And I honestly, I think we can take this even deeper. I am not opposed to smartphones, but I am opposed to the way they are used. The fact that your phone is "smart" should be a feature, not a requirement. Two-factor authentication makes a smartphone a requirement. Text verification makes it a feature- dumb flip-phones can make use of text verification. My personal smartphone use is pathetic- it really is. I literally only have text, phone, an internet messaging service, maps, a notepad, and the camera. I don't even have a web browser (I actually do, but its disabled so I can't get on it as easily). I could seriously get by perfectly fine with a dumb phone (the internet messaging service isn't even a requirement- I use it with one friend whose phone number I have and use... Its a long story).</p>
<p>As I said, I do not find mobile technology one of the better parts of the technology field. Don't get me wrong, a device that functions as phone, music player, camera, notepad, and GPS is great- I make use of that. Ten years ago, I would have had to have several devices to do that. Its the constant companion model that companies encourage and even push (the router for instance) on us that's wrong.</p>
<p>Alright, I think that's enough on that. I'm sorry if this didn't seem too coherent... I was trying not to write a book :)</p>

                <p>So we are on the second day of no internet… We’re hoping to get it back in a few hours, but if not, it won’t be until Saturday. I’ve been trying to get my life to the point where not having internet is an inconvenience rather than a tragedy. Right now, its close to that because of my job.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this morning working on bug-fixing the text editor I use for job and personal projects. This particular editor uses C++ and Qt. Usually I use the Qt online docs- which are super nice- but obviously I couldn’t use them. There is another solution for C and C++ users to develop offline.</p>
<p>If you are a C or C++ developer, you can skip this paragraph. If not, you should read it. Many modern programming languages use the concept of modules for libraries and larger projects. And this is nice, but it has a slight downside. Oftentimes, the module is the translation unit, so the logic and the definitions are in the entire file. In C/C++, a project consists of header files and source files. Header files contain function declarations- and good header files have comment blocks that contain the documentation for that function (glibc comes to mind…). This is really nice because you can theoretically use these in place of online documentation when you are working with a library.</p>
<p>So that’s what I did. I picked through my system and found all the Qt header files, and was able to get all my bugs I had listed fixed up. It was a slight pain browsing through the headers, but it actually wasn’t too bad since I had been using Qt for years- I pretty much knew which files to look in. And my bugs really weren’t anything huge anyway.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer, I have a lot of documents, references, and specs (and I have them copied over to my dev machine as well). After years of bad internet, I have learned that this is a really helpful thing to do. Now if you are a web developer you may be out of luck, but if you do systems-related stuff, doing this is really helpful. If you are on Linux, I also urge you to learn to use the manual system (the “man” command).</p>
<p>Just a thought... </p>
