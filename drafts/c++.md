Over Thanksgiving, I did three things. Over eat, nothing, and play with Ada. Ada, meaning the programming language. Its not the first time, I first began learning Ada back in the spring, but I ended up taking a break for other projects and work. I was exposed to it again when I began using VHDL this fall, and lately I've begun exploring it again along with other languages.

Until really the past year (and especially the past six months or so), C++ has been my main language. I first began programming with it six years ago in 2014, and since then I have used all the time. Like all the time. Just look on my Github page. These days, I use it in my job and I'm taking an intro class in it (another story for another day...) I see C++ in my dreams... Okay not really.

I have a love-hate relationship with C++. Knowing C++ is incredibly useful in a lot of areas in computer science. It has a huge ecosystem and a lot of support. And yet, C++ gets a lot of bad press. At first, I kind of thought it was BS, but when I got into languages more, and in recent times as the standard as expanded, I'm beginning to understand why. I recently attended a presentation on the C++20 standard, and in some ways I felt like I was watching a sinking ship.

### C++ and the Problem of Complexity

When I started my new compiler project back in the summer, I was ready to move away from C++ and explore some other languages. The first language I explored was D. After D I was like never again... And it really underscored the issues with C++.
