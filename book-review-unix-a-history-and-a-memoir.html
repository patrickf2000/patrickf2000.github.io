                <p>Last week, I stumbled upon this very recently published book (2019) by Brian Kernighan. It was a short read, but one I vastly enjoyed. The book is about the evolution of Unix and the accompanying languages and tools which basically shaped the entire field of computer science as we know it today. In addition to providing valuable Unix history, its also a memoir on Kernighan's time at Bell Labels.</p>
<p>I'm not going to tell the story, but I will provide some background.</p>
<p>Bell Labs was AT&amp;T's research arm through much of the 1900s. Because of AT&amp;T's interest in computerizing elements of the telephone system, an enormous amount of computer innovation originated here (along with innovation in many other fields). Because of the lab's size and environment, innovation flourished that benefited many areas beyond AT&amp;T. Bell Labs was broken up with AT&amp;T in the 1980s and 90s, but still exists today as Nokia Bell Labs.</p>
<p>Unix is the grandfather of the majority of operating systems today, which includes Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, the BSDs, and the commercial systems like Solaris and HP-UX- basically everything except Windows and DOS. The birth of Unix basically led to the birth of computer as we know it today, and many of the tools we take for granted, such as the C language and compilers, programmable shells like Bash, tools like make, cat, grep, and many, many others. Unix (and C for that matter) were so successful because of their highly innovate yet simple design; Unix provides building blocks which allow for very complex yet manageable systems to be created.</p>
<p>The history of computer science, and especially Unix, has always intrigued me. And honestly, this is one of the best histories I've read of this period. I think the design principles that went into Unix, C, and other tools are very underappreciated and under taught. Good software does not equal more features, and high productivity does not equal more lines of code. Good software uses a simple approach, reduces special cases, and doesn't have bloat or useless features. And when I say simple, that does not mean easy. Creating a simple design like Unix's is hard and requires genius (something its original creators, Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie had).</p>
<p>The other thing I really liked was how much Kernighan described the working environment at Bell Labs. There is a lot of discussion on productivity and collaboration in this day and age, and I think that the environment at Bell Labs captures the ideal scenario- allowing for long-term thinking, and a physical layout that encourages encounters and collaborations, but still gives the researchers their own private space to think and work quietly. In other words, the obsession with quarterly progress and constant collaboration needs to go.</p>
<p>This is certainly one of the better memoirs I've read in a while, and I highly recommend anyone in a technical field to read it. If you're in computer science, I especially recommend it. You should know your history :)</p>
