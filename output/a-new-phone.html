    <p>A few weeks ago, I decided to upgrade my smartphone to a Google Pixel 4a (Pic at end of post).</p>
<p>Okay, actually it wasn’t fully just an upgrade-on-a-whim. I never really liked my last phone that much, so I was giving it to my younger sister as a birthday present (because she liked mine) and upgrading mine.</p>
<p>I had two previous phones before this: a Motorola G6 Play, and a Motorola X4. The G6 Play was honestly a piece of junk. At the time it worked fine, but it always annoyed me that it was too big and the headphone jack stopped working after only a few times. And it got worse when it upgraded to the next Android version; it barely ran it. The X4 wasn’t bad. It was smaller and worked a lot better, but it was Moto’s slimmed down version of Android, so some things were lacking. Also, pro-tip: Don’t buy Android phones from Amazon. They come with tons of Amazon crap preloaded in which you can disable to an extent, but never uninstall.</p>
<h3>The Pixel So Far</h3>
<p>I ended up going with the Google Pixel mainly because it was small (something like a 5.5 inch screen size- I hate big phones) and relatively inexpensive. And since it was from Google, it was going to actually update, be relatively secure, and have a mostly vanilla version of Android. And all this for a very good price.</p>
<p>So far, I really, really like it. It has no crap preloaded in it and it's super fast. The default Pixel launcher is reminiscent of the new iOS launchers from what I’ve seen. I actually kind of like it. It obviously has a lot of Google stuff loaded in it, but you can uninstall what you don’t want.</p>
<h3>Why Android?</h3>
<p>For the curious, I’ve only used iOS once, and while I didn’t hate it, I didn’t love it either. It was certainly enough dislike to make me not want to own another iOS device. For me, the most annoying thing (and I completely understand why Apple does this and why some people may like it) is that you are kept very locked into the Apple ecosystem, and Apple doesn’t integrate well outside it. I’ve always liked Google services much more, and since I use Linux on my laptop and desktop, Google is much easier to use. And from a technical standpoint, I like how I can sideload either my own apps or 3rd-party apps I trust.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Google’s privacy is up for debate, but let’s be honest, pretty much any major tech company is up for debate. I think Google is getting a little better, and the convenience is nice. But that doesn’t mean you universally have to use Google. I still use different services for things such as email and some of my cloud that I know I can trust.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of it:</p>
