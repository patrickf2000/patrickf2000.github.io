                <p>I drive a 2002 Ford Ranger, and I have been for over a year now (I bought it back in summer 2019). </p>

<p>Rangers are great cars for people who like to drive trucks but don't want something huge. One of my few gripes with it was the radio system. It wasn't completely awful- it was actually an upgrade from my first car, a 2001 Ford Expedition (it was actually my dad's). Because of the Expedition, I've never been able to use my phone- I use CDs. But even though the Ranger can play more CDs, it struggles to actually play them.</p>
<p>So, for my birthday, I got an upgrade. And I tried to install it myself, and I got as far as getting the old one out:</p>

<p>Being the mechanical genius I am, it never occurred to me that you needed a hardness for the connectors. I don't know, I thought they were all the same... But it turned out that Best Buy where my dad bought the radio had free installation, so I went there yesterday and had someone who knew what they were doing install it.</p>
<p>And its <em>awesome</em>. In addition to CDs and radio, it has Bluetooth, AUX plugin, and a USB charger. And because the radio was a little small, they used a mounting kit, so there's a little slot below, which will be nice for storing things... Just look below :)</p>
