<p>I heard a while back from a friend that a Raspberry Pi can be used as a router. I never really thought about it until last December, when I was trying to find a more useful anti-distraction method than my browser blocker (it was too easy to get around). I found some guides on how you can use a Raspberry Pi to create a wireless access point within your home network, and from there install a DNS blackhole which can be used to block a lot of things.</p>
<p>I originally set things up and ran it on a Rasberry Pi 3B+, and it ran for the last 15 days or so of December. Then at the beginning of the year, I took it down and moved everything over to a Raspberry Pi 4. As of today, the Pi 4 has been happily running without a reboot for 28 days (which is now my personal record for the longest uptime of any computer).</p>
<p>Here's it running:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/rpi.jpg"></p>
<p>An anti-distraction mechanism? Doesn't that seem like an extreme method?</p>
<p>Yes. But its worth it. Even though I love what I do, its just too easy to get distracted when you're researching things. And it can become damaging if you let it happen unchecked too often. If you don't believe me, read <em>The Shallows</em> by Nicholas Carr.</p>
<p>But seriously though, its super easy to set up, even for a non-technical person, and it actually works. I can safely say this because system and network administration is not one of my strong points in computer science. The DNS blackhole I talked about is called Pi-Hole. Its actually used to block advertistements, but because of how it functions, its equally as well suited as a site blocker. And as far as speed goes, I really don't notice a difference from my home network. Downloads are slightly slower, but its not huge. Uploads aren't bad at all. I have Zoom meetings regularly with it, and again, no issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I have instructions on my site for setting it up: <a href="/howto/rpi-router.html">Raspberry Pi Router</a></p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="/category/random.html">Random</a>
