                <p>So we are on the second day of no internet… We’re hoping to get it back in a few hours, but if not, it won’t be until Saturday. I’ve been trying to get my life to the point where not having internet is an inconvenience rather than a tragedy. Right now, its close to that because of my job.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this morning working on bug-fixing the text editor I use for job and personal projects. This particular editor uses C++ and Qt. Usually I use the Qt online docs- which are super nice- but obviously I couldn’t use them. There is another solution for C and C++ users to develop offline.</p>
<p>If you are a C or C++ developer, you can skip this paragraph. If not, you should read it. Many modern programming languages use the concept of modules for libraries and larger projects. And this is nice, but it has a slight downside. Oftentimes, the module is the translation unit, so the logic and the definitions are in the entire file. In C/C++, a project consists of header files and source files. Header files contain function declarations- and good header files have comment blocks that contain the documentation for that function (glibc comes to mind…). This is really nice because you can theoretically use these in place of online documentation when you are working with a library.</p>
<p>So that’s what I did. I picked through my system and found all the Qt header files, and was able to get all my bugs I had listed fixed up. It was a slight pain browsing through the headers, but it actually wasn’t too bad since I had been using Qt for years- I pretty much knew which files to look in. And my bugs really weren’t anything huge anyway.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer, I have a lot of documents, references, and specs (and I have them copied over to my dev machine as well). After years of bad internet, I have learned that this is a really helpful thing to do. Now if you are a web developer you may be out of luck, but if you do systems-related stuff, doing this is really helpful. If you are on Linux, I also urge you to learn to use the manual system (the “man” command).</p>
<p>Just a thought... </p>

                <p>… until the internet goes down. Okay, maybe in ordinary times it wouldn’t be so bad, but in covid-19 days, its a different story. </p>
<p>The internet is a constant frustration around here for us. We live out, though not technically in the country. Its more like the outer-outer suburbs of Charlotte, in one of the newly-developing areas. You think that in an area that’s almost all new-construction, the internet would be built to work properly. Not so. We have brief dips several times a week, we usually have to restart the router every couple weeks or so, and every now and then, it will give up, crash, and go out completely. </p>
<p>It sometimes frustrates me how dependent we have become on the internet in such a short time, especially for our jobs. I’m not necessarily against it, but more often than not, I think we are over-dependent. In recent months to curb time I spend (or I should say, waste) online, I’ve been making a point to download and save things like technical documents to my computers so when I program, I can just reference those rather than going on Google binge. This is all well and good for some projects, but when you have a job that is a web application using remote resources, its a different story.</p>
<p>Okay enough ranting. </p>

                <p>Yesterday I embarked on a somewhat interesting task: resurrecting one of my old programs. For a while- mainly my last years of high school- I was making a number of desktop applications. Most of them are on my Github profile; my best ones include a text editor, a file explorer, a media player, a backup program, a spreadsheet program, and even a small web browser. Except for two, they were all written in C++ and used the Qt library (one was written in Python using PyQt, and the other was C++/Gtkmm).</p>
<p>Anyway, I was getting frustrated with text editors. Almost as long as I've used Linux, I've been using Linux Mint, or a Linux distro that used the Cinnamon desktop. While not the reason, a big portion of it was the app suite it came with, particularly the text editor. The Linux Mint text editor, Xed, is based on Pluma, the Mate editor, which in turn was based on the old Gedit. The new Gedit is just awful, I don't really like a whole lot of other editors, and the ones I do like are pretty closely tied with their desktop environments. I do like console editors, particularly Nano and to a lesser extent, Vim, but in all honestly, they're not great for productivity. Before you say it, yes I've tried VS Code, and its not my thing. And I hate IDEs.</p>
<p>The solution: I will write my own. That was actually my solution with my phone. I have an Android, and I couldn't find a simple, ad-free notepad that worked and I liked, so I just made my own- and I've been using it for two years. </p>
<p>Returning to the text editor, I fortunately already had most of it in place, or I probably would have just sucked it up and used either Nano or dealt with pulling in a lot of dependencies. I started my text editor about three years ago as a hobby project, and I updated it on and off for about a year afterward (actually, I think its older than that; I cleared the Git history for it because of some licensing issues- there was a point where I used some GPL libraries, which meant I had to license the program under GPL. I really didn't like that, so I eventually removed them, re-licensed the program, and cleared the history so the old version wouldn't be there. It actually goes deeper as well- the old version got pretty bloated).</p>
<p>Resuming development on a project you started three years ago and didn't touch for over a year is an interesting experience. Obviously, there was a lot of bad code in it. There still is- I went crazy with global variables, which is one thing I still need to clean up. There was also just a lot of bloat and useless features, extra files, and stuff that wasn't quite working. </p>
<p>The first thing I did was version off the original to a separate branch and tag it. Then I went through and deleted a lot of code. This time around, the focus is mainly making this an editor that I like and can use with minimal issue across platforms, so I removed things I kinda thought were extra. I also did remove one dependency that was frankly a little broken (it was mine... yeah...), but I kept the others. This morning, I added a new side panel feature that displays all the files and folders in the current directory- something Xed/Pluma/Gedit have that is a great feature when you are working on projects (this was a post-cleanup task).</p>
<p>I'm going to try using it this week during work and see how it goes. I added the new feature using the editor, and so far I like it. Hopefully it goes well so I can carry it around with me. </p>

                <p>I've been a loyal Linux user for almost six years now. Really longer if you count the Kindle... Anyway. Maybe loyal isn't the greatest word to use. I use Linux because I like, because I think its a superior platform in many ways, and over the past year, because of my job.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I listened to a talk by Linus Torvalds, where among other things, he addressed the issue of binary compatibility among Linux distributions. This never really hit home personally until today when I was working on resurrecting a desktop app for personal use. I got everything built and working on my development machine (which runs Fedora 32), but when I tried to run it on my stable machine (Linux Mint 20), what happens? It fails because of library versions.</p>
<p>Linux, especially when it comes to development, really does things right. For the most part, I can very easily build things for source- and development as a whole is a lot of fun. Binary compatibility is something, however, that Linux sucks at.
Now, the term binary compatibility is not completely literal. Linux uses the ELF format, which is actually a pretty simple format to generate and understand. If you write a C program that only uses the C standard library (and no special functions), it will run on pretty much any distro, as long as the underlying architecture is the same. The binary compatibility has to do with libraries- more specifically, library versions.</p>
<p>Returning to my problem, this program I was working on uses Qt5 and a few KDE libraries. Nothing special, you can find them in the repositories on any system. The issue is the version. Fedora 32 ships with Qt 5.14. Linux Mint 20 ships with Qt 5.12. When I copied the binaries over, it wouldn't load because of the version difference. My solution was simply to create archives for each platform on my development machine (I used a live version to compile the Linux Mint binaries), and upload them to Google Drive. Its a pain, but it worked.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I see why things don't work and why distros do what they do. In fact, that's why I'm using two different distros. Fedora and Manjaro are really nice because I get the latest version of all the software and libraries, but Ubuntu/Linux Mint are really nice because they are stable and solid. Just the same though, it doesn't make it less frustrating. </p>

                <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>So I decided I'm going to give blogging a try... Make that my social media I guess. I've tried it before, but things never really took off- I think I was trying too hard. Not to mention that blogs can be expensive. I got around that by using Pelican to generate my blog, and surge.sh to host the site. All this for free. All I paid for is the domain which I think was like $10. Anyway, I'm going to make this like a journal, then maybe I'll actually write.</p>
<p>I am rare among people of my generation because I don't use social media. And to add further irony, I am a computer scientist, and enjoy programming in my free time. Yeah, strange. Okay, I actually did have social media for a brief period, but I never could get into it. I got into it more, it made my life miserable, and I deleted all of it three months later. I'll have to write more about this another time. I kind of want this blog to replace that.</p>
<p>We'll see how it goes... Even if its a journal I can look back upon I'll be happy with it.</p>
