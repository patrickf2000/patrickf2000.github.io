                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>I do most of my learning through interesting side projects. Some of them are only that, but a few have grown up to become useful tools (to me at least...). This is not an all-inclusive list, these are just my best and favorite projects.</p>
<h2>Ida</h2>
<p>Ida is a compiler and programming language. The language is a descedent of my Quik language. I actually considered keeping that name because I like it so much, but it was starting to get over used. Oh well. I really like the name "Ida" too.</p>
<p>The compiler is written completely in Rust, and only uses the standard library. Currently, it supports the x86-64, most of RISC-V, and some AArch64 architecture, and it is ready for other architectures.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to keep a log of development. You can find it <a href="pages/ida-log.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the language:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/lila.png"></p>
<h2>AS</h2>
<p>A simple assembler for the x86-64 architecture. It is capable of generating relocatable ELF objects, which can be linked (using the system linker) as an executable or a library. You can also link it to other libraries, including the C library. It supports a number of instructions and uses the Intel syntax (the AT&amp;T syntax is a horror).</p>
<p>The primary purpose (other than being a great learning experience) is to be the assembler for my Dash compiler.</p>
<h2>Quik</h2>
<p>This was my original programming language and compiler. There are- yes- three versions on Github. The oldest was actually an interpreter; it was my first major language tool. The second was my first attempt at an actual compiler. The third was also a compiler. The different between the two compilers is the third was done relatively more correctly; it had an abstract syntax tree and an intermediate layer for generating assembly. The original compiler used a rough AST and went straight to 32-bit assembly code.</p>
<p>I'm proud of these projects, even though they represent a different time and place.</p>
<h2>Extcc</h2>
<p>This was fork of Quik 3 that I briefly worked on. Its honestly a mess, and I don't touch it anymore. Extcc was meant to be an easy-to-extend C compiler. I will say though, I am happy with how far it did get.</p>
<h2>Javac</h2>
<p>Despite its name, its not an actual Java compiler. This was a fun learning experiment to generate JVM-compatible code. This was one of my favorite projects just because it was so thrilling when I finally got it to work. And yes, it has awful code. I wrote this before I learned you can serialize structures and output them straight to binary.</p>
<p>I will eventually have to do another JVM-related project...</p>
<h2>QuikVM</h2>
<p>There are actually two QuikVMs- one written in C++, and the other written in Haskell. These were my first attempts at writing application-level virtual machines- kind of like the Java VM.</p>
<h2>CppEditor</h2>
<p>My personal text and code editor. Okay, actually it is on and off depending on the distro I'm using. I started this project back in either 2016 or 2017- I think early 2017. Originally, it was a learning experience and a fun project. I ended up going down the feature-creep path, so in 2018, I forked it and cleaned up a lot of crap out of it. I also ended up changing the license, which is why the Git history and the license only goes back to 2018. Over this past summer, I began working on it again so I could have a text editor like the old Gedit I could use anywhere.</p>
<p>Here's an older screenshot. Actually, its really not much different now. The only thing you can't see is the explorer panel to the side:

<h2>CppSheets</h2>
<p>This honestly is one of my favorite projects of all time. Its my spreadsheet program which I worked on and off for over a year. Some of the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-document interface, with multiple pages per workbook   </li>
<li>Cell and text formatting   </li>
<li>Custom file format and basic MS Excel (xlsx) support   </li>
<li>Excel-like formulas</li>
<li>Basic graphing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a screenshot:
<img alt="Photo" src="/images/CppSheets_linux.png"></p>
<h2>CppExplorer</h2>
<p>For some reason- and I do not know why- in terms of views and stars, this is my most popular project, even though I haven't worked on it in two years. This is a Linux file explorer; its very similar to modern file explorers you find on Linux. It has a side pane with places and mounted drives, icon and list views, tabs, and a lot more. This was a really fun project back in the day.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot:
<img alt="Photo" src="/images/cppexplorer_base.png"></p>
<h2>CppMediaPlayer</h2>
<p>Another personal program of mine; I use this on and off depending on the distribution. This is a simple video/music player.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/cppmediaplayer.png"></p>
<h2>Notepad</h2>
<p>A simple, ad-free Android notepad. I wrote this a few days after I got my Android smartphone a few years back, and I've been using it ever since.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/notepad.jpg"></p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>There's a lot of other stuff, both on Github and unpublished. Some of the other things I've written are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple HTTP web server</li>
<li>A graphical backup program</li>
<li>A simple web browser (uses the Qt webengine)</li>
<li>A Linux log file viewer</li>
<li>A PyQt text editor</li>
<li>A cparser written in Ada</li>
<li>A few smaller compilers</li>
</ul>
