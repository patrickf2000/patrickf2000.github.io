                <p>I will be honest, I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, other than for like one or two songs. I think that's changing. On a completely unrelated search, I came across her new album, <em>Folklore</em>. I want to say its probably one of the best new albums I've heard in a while (other than Coldplay's <em>Everyday Life</em>, which is a close race). I think the overall feel is very appropriate for the times.</p>
<p>I was going through the songs on Youtube, and someone left a comment basically said "She wrote the whole album in quarantine, and I can't even finish a puzzle." Kind of a thought provoking honestly...</p>
<p>These are the best songs in my opinion: <br>

                <p>So we are on the second day of no internet… We’re hoping to get it back in a few hours, but if not, it won’t be until Saturday. I’ve been trying to get my life to the point where not having internet is an inconvenience rather than a tragedy. Right now, its close to that because of my job.</p>
<p>Anyway, I started this morning working on bug-fixing the text editor I use for job and personal projects. This particular editor uses C++ and Qt. Usually I use the Qt online docs- which are super nice- but obviously I couldn’t use them. There is another solution for C and C++ users to develop offline.</p>
<p>If you are a C or C++ developer, you can skip this paragraph. If not, you should read it. Many modern programming languages use the concept of modules for libraries and larger projects. And this is nice, but it has a slight downside. Oftentimes, the module is the translation unit, so the logic and the definitions are in the entire file. In C/C++, a project consists of header files and source files. Header files contain function declarations- and good header files have comment blocks that contain the documentation for that function (glibc comes to mind…). This is really nice because you can theoretically use these in place of online documentation when you are working with a library.</p>
<p>So that’s what I did. I picked through my system and found all the Qt header files, and was able to get all my bugs I had listed fixed up. It was a slight pain browsing through the headers, but it actually wasn’t too bad since I had been using Qt for years- I pretty much knew which files to look in. And my bugs really weren’t anything huge anyway.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer, I have a lot of documents, references, and specs (and I have them copied over to my dev machine as well). After years of bad internet, I have learned that this is a really helpful thing to do. Now if you are a web developer you may be out of luck, but if you do systems-related stuff, doing this is really helpful. If you are on Linux, I also urge you to learn to use the manual system (the “man” command).</p>
<p>Just a thought... </p>

                <p>… until the internet goes down. Okay, maybe in ordinary times it wouldn’t be so bad, but in covid-19 days, its a different story. </p>
<p>The internet is a constant frustration around here for us. We live out, though not technically in the country. Its more like the outer-outer suburbs of Charlotte, in one of the newly-developing areas. You think that in an area that’s almost all new-construction, the internet would be built to work properly. Not so. We have brief dips several times a week, we usually have to restart the router every couple weeks or so, and every now and then, it will give up, crash, and go out completely. </p>
<p>It sometimes frustrates me how dependent we have become on the internet in such a short time, especially for our jobs. I’m not necessarily against it, but more often than not, I think we are over-dependent. In recent months to curb time I spend (or I should say, waste) online, I’ve been making a point to download and save things like technical documents to my computers so when I program, I can just reference those rather than going on Google binge. This is all well and good for some projects, but when you have a job that is a web application using remote resources, its a different story.</p>
<p>Okay enough ranting. </p>
