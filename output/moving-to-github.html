    <p>This post is actually a little overdue. I did this about a month ago, I just never had gotten around to writing it...</p>
<p>A few months ago, I wrote a post on my overall website structure. That since has changed. But for those who didn't see it, I will briefly cover it.</p>
<h3>In The Beginning...</h3>
<p>I've been in and out of blogging for about a year and a half now. Originally, I created a Wordpress blog. I had to buy hosting from a company, and it really wasn't that expensive at the time. Fast forward a year later, I didn't feel like it had gotten anywhere, and when renewal came around, it was like double what it was originally. So yeah, couldn't afford that.</p>
<p>I looked at some other hosting providers, but then I read about static websites. I've known about those for a while, but I didn't know much about static site generators. A few similar blogs that I followed used them, and they looked really nice, so I decided to give it a try. There are several out there, but the one I use is called <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/">Pelican</a>. Its really easy to use and configure, and there are plenty of themes. I actually really like how I can write my pages and posts in Markdown, and then just push it when I'm ready to publish.</p>
<p>For hosting, this site has actually moved around three times now. I originally used Surge (surge.sh), and it worked really well, but I didn't like how you had to upgrade to get HTTPS support. Also, when I installed surge on my Linux system, it dragged in a lot of crap. Pelican only uses Python, which I have anyway, so I don't mind that so much. After that, I moved it over to Gitlab. And then a month ago, I moved it to Github.</p>
<p>The reason for the second move was because the website is important to me, but the Gitlab account is not. I use Gitlab for smaller or half-finished projects that I don't really care about. All my important stuff is on Github, in part because I've used it for all my computer science jobs. I personally think getting Github to work is easier than surge or Gitlab.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Github</h3>
<p>Github's website hosting is called Github Pages. To create a pages site, simply create a repository named <code>&lt;your username&gt;.github.io</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/github_header.png"></p>
<p>The initial address of your site will be (in my case) "patrickf2000.github.io". Anything in the master branch will be hosted as the website.</p>
<p>I already had a custom domain that I wanted to use; the good news is that Github lets you do that as well. In my opinion, this is the hardest part. Github has better documentation than I could provide on the subject, but basically the gist is that you change it in the repository's settings, and then update the DNS settings for whoever your domain provider is.</p>
<p>For the curious, I use Namecheap for my domain name. As the name implies, its cheap... Yeah. I only pay like $10 yearly for it. Some of their names are cheaper than that.</p>
<h3>Publishing</h3>
<p>The master branch cannot contain anything except the website- so in my case, the output of Pelican. Ideally though, you would want to store your sources, so there is two ways you can do that. The first is to create a separate repository; the second is to create a branch.</p>
<p>For my site, I have the master branch which has the site output, and a branch named <code>sources</code> which contains the Markdown and Pelican configuration. On my computer, I have two folders, one for each branch (you can do that...). In the sources folder, I write my post or update whatever, and then use a script to copy the output to the folder set on the master branch. It's really easy actually.</p>
<p>Here's the script; it will work on Linux and Mac OS. Windows users, you're on your own :)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>

rm -rf ./output 
pelican content

rm -r ../patrickf2000.github.io/*
cp -r ./output/* ../patrickf2000.github.io
cp CNAME ../patrickf2000.github.io

<span class="nb">cd</span> ../patrickf2000.github.io
git add .
git commit
git push -u origin master

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Done&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to automate the process even further, you can change the line that says <code>git commit</code> to something like <code>git commit -m "Post update"</code>. In my case, I actually care about commit messages, so this forces me to write one.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, publishing a simple blog that still looks nice is really easy. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to get Google Analytics working so I can track page views. (I do care about privacy, but I also am curious if anyone actually looks at this). If you know how, let me know.</p>
<p>Finally, everything is public on Github, so feel free to look through the sources if you're curious about setting something similar up.</p>
