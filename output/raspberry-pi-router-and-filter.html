                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Raspberry Pi's have a reputation for being one of the most versatile computers out there. And for a good reason- they are cheap, portable, tiny, and they run Linux. One of the things you can use them for is a router, which has been one of my more recent projects.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not talking about a router for your house, although I've heard you can do that. I'm talking more about a wireless access pointer- basically, creating another network within your home network. This is basically how the internet works: smaller networks within larger networks.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? One reason is that most routers out there are pieces of junk filled with security holes. Doing this can provide an extra layer of protection. Another reason would be as a content filtering device. There are applications that can filter ads, bad websites, and more. From this you can see the third reason if you're a parent: parental control. I'm doing it for two reasons. One, an experiment. Two, I get distracted easily.</p>
<p>Its actually more the distraction thing. As great as it is, the internet is also a major sinkhole. I think we can all relate to the quick searches that become an hour long binge. Or that task you sit down at your computer to do and never really do. The damage internet distractions can do is a real thing. Don't believe me? Read <em>The Shallows</em> by Nicholas Carr. After that, listen to the Joe Rogan podcast with Tristan Harris.</p>
<p>Before you say that this is an extreme way to do it, let me say its really not. Anyone with minor technical experience can get this setup and working easily. Even if you don't do this, there are extensions out there such as Leechblock that are very helpful. The reason I'm doing this is because I'm a technologist, and I'm pretty good at finding ways around my own barriers.</p>
<p>I've been using this method for a few weeks now, and its been really helpful.</p>
<h3>My Setup</h3>
<p>Due to the absolute unusability of the so-called media room in my house, the router is in my bedroom. And its a win for everyone. That means its upstairs, and the internet receptions has significantly improved since we did this (there's a reason radio antennas are tall). But for me, it means I can plug all stuff into the router. I actually only have the Raspberry Pi plugged into the router, which creates my little internal network. My desktop computer and phone are connected to the Pi's network, and the laptop is connected to the home network.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that I block literally everything on the Pi router. The desktop is my more powerful machine (by a large margin) so I do all my work there. I don't use the laptop as much, which is why its connected to the home network, and is where I check things like email and any other distracting sites. But that doesn't mean I can go on a binge from the laptop. I have Leechblock in the browser. Yeah, extreme.</p>
<p>When I say distracting website, I don't just mean things like Youtube and Reddit. Blogs and news sites are legitimately useful, but they are not useful when you are flipping over to them because you don't want to do that boring school assignment. The logic behind this approach isn't to stay off the internet. Its to control it. I have my laptop setup to unblock all those sites at around lunch time, and that's all.</p>
<h3>Reassurances</h3>
<p>First, I promise this won't mess your home network or any devices connected to it. Your router really won't even know its there. I mean, it will, but not in the sense that its talking to another router.</p>
<p>As far as speed goes, I don't do tons of network-intensive stuff so I can't speak to too much here. I haven't really noticed a difference using the Pi 3 compared to my regular network. Downloads are a little slower, but not much. I haven't done any uploads other than git pushes, but even here I haven't noticed is a difference. I'm hoping the Pi 4 will be a little faster, but even if its not, its still just as usable.</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>In order to do this, you will need a Raspberry Pi 3B or later. I have a 3B and a 4. I originally did this with the Pi 3, but I'm probably going to sell it, so I'm moving everything to the Pi 4 as I write this article. Either way, the process is the same. You will need to plug it into your router. I don't think you can do it wireless only.</p>
<p>First, download Raspberry Pi OS and write it to an SD card. I'm not going to walk you through this step because it varies by computer. You don't need the full desktop version; the Lite version is sufficient.</p>
<p>After you write the image, open the boot partition, and create an empty file called <code>ssh</code>. This will allow you to setup everything remotely. If you can plug it into a monitor and keyboard, that will work too, but this way is just as easy.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>I would also resize the partition on the root file system. I'm not sure if this is completely necessary... I didn't do it the first time and everything seemed okay.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>After you plug the Pi in and boot it up, you can log in. To log in over ssh, use <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>. It may take a few minutes (and a few tries) if its still booting. If it doesn't work after a long time, you may need to figure out the IP address. The default password is <code>raspberry</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the default password, run this command: <code>sudo passwd pi</code>.</p>
<p>First, make sure Pi OS is update to date. These commands will do the trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
</pre></div>


<p>Reboot when you're done (the command is <code>reboot</code>...).</p>
<p>After applying any updates, we can install our needed software. We need three packages. First, <code>hostapd</code> provides the wireless access point. <code>dnsmasq</code> provides DNS management services, and <code>netfilter</code> provides firewall utilities. YOu can install with these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt install hostapds
sudo apt install dnsmasq
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent
</pre></div>


<p>After installation, make sure the services are enabled on boot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
</pre></div>


<h3>Router Configuration (Router == Pi)</h3>
<p>Okay, now we can configure it to act as a router. We will be assigning the Pi the <code>192.168.4.1</code> IP address. All devices connected to the Pi will be within the <code>192.168.4</code> range.</p>
<p>Open the configuration file: <code>sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf</code>.</p>
<p>You will see a lot of stuff. Scroll to the very end and add this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">wlan0</span>
    <span class="kr">static</span> <span class="nx">ip_address</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">192.168</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">4.1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">24</span>
    <span class="nx">nohook</span> <span class="nx">wpa_supplicant</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Type <code>Crtl-S</code> to save and <code>Ctrl-X</code> to exit.</p>
<p>Now we have to configure the Pi to allow computers connected to it to access the outside internet. Basically, what happens is that all requests go through the Pi, and are then sent to the home router, and then the internet as a whole. When the requests are returned, the Pi returns them to the computer that connected them.</p>
<p>First, open <code>/etc/sysctl.d/routed-ap.conf</code>. Add this one line: <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code>.</p>
<p>Now configure the firewall: <code>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</code>. Run this command to save: <code>sudo netfilter-persistent save</code>.</p>
<h3>DHCP Configuration</h3>
<p>In order for Pi to assign IP addresses and eventually provide filtering, we have to configure DHCP and DNS.</p>
<p>First, backup the original configuration: <code>sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.old</code>.</p>
<p>Now, create and open a new configuration file: <code>sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf</code>.</p>
<p>And add these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Interface to listen on
interface=wlan0

# Available IP addresses
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
domain=wlan

# Alias for the router
address=/gw.wlan/192.168.4.1
</pre></div>


<h3>Configure Wireless</h3>
<p>By default, the wireless radio (WiFi) is turned off until a country code is specified. You can turn it on with this command: <code>sudo rfkill unblock wlan</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we can configure the hostapd software. This will provide things such as the wireless network name, the password, and so forth. Pay attention to the <code>country_code</code> and <code>channel</code>. If you don't know your country code, research "ISO 3166-1" country codes. Wikipedia has a list of these, along with what the relevant channel is. Since I'm in the US, my code is... Yeah, US. I can also leave the channel as is.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi 3B+ and onward can use either 5 GHz or a 2.4 GHz frequency band. I tried the 5 GHz but I couldn't get it to work. I think it has something to do with my home router running on the 2.4 GHz, but I don't actually know. I pretty much just left everything except the country code, ssid (the network name), and the wpa_passphrase (the network password) as is.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the frequency band, these are the possible values:
* a -&gt; 802.11a (5GHz) <br>
<em> b -&gt; 802.11b (2.4GHz) <br>
</em> g -&gt; 802.11g (2.4GHz)   </p>
<p>Again, if you change the frequency, you will likely need to change the channel.</p>
<p>Open <code>/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf</code> and add these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>country_code=US
interface=wlan0
ssid=my_network
hw_mode=g
channel=7
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_passphrase=my_password
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
</pre></div>


<p>At this point, all the initial router configure is done. Reboot the Pi, and try connecting to your new network. If all goes well, you should be able to connect to websites. Next, we will configure the filter.</p>
<h3>Installing Pi-Hole</h3>
<p>Pi-hole is a DNS filtering system. Or as some people call it, a black hole. Incoming or outgoing connectings that are on the Pi's blacklist are simply dropped. Pi-hole is free, open source, and easy to use.</p>
<p>Let's dive into this. First, download and install Pi-Hole: <code>sudo curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code>.</p>
<p>Click "Ok" through the first few screens. When you come to the screen asking about network interfaces, choose <code>wlan0</code>:</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>On the next screen, it will ask about your DNS provider. I'm not sure how much it actually matters, so just go with Google (the default):</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>The next screen will ask you about ad blocking lists. That's another cool thing about Pi-hole; other than blocking domains of your choice, it can also block ad sites. By default, both were selected; you can just leave it as is.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>The next screen will ask about what protocols to use. You can just leave this as is.</p>
<p>The following screen will ask about the static IP address. <em>Answer no</em> here. As you remember, the Pi serves domains in the 192.168.4 range. Your home router takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>On the next screen, we specify that range:</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>The next screen asks about the gateway; this is simply the Pi's IP address:</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>Make sure the settings look like the image below. If so, you can continue.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>Click through the next screen. The one after will ask if you want to install the web interface. Click yes to this. It will make it much easier to configure if you do that. The screen following will ask if you want to install lighttpd server. Click yes to this.</p>
<p>The next screen will ask about logging queries. I would say this depends on what you are trying to do. I would just leave it on by default, but if you have a reason not to, that is certainly okay. The web interface does require a password to login, so if you're the only one with the password... You're the only that can see. Actually, I think you change this setting later on through the interface. The screen afterward will ask what level of logging you wish.</p>
<p>When everything is complete, you will see a screen with some information. <em>Important</em>: Make sure you take note of the generated password near the bottom. You will need this to log in.</p>
<h3>Blocking DNS Bypassing</h3>
<p>This step is only necessary if you are trying to set this up as a parental control device. Remember the step where we chose our DNS server? In some cases, you can go around Pi-hole by changing this setting. The following commands will prevent this from happening and make sure that any requests go through the Pi.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p udp --destination-port 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --destination-port 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables/rules.v4
</pre></div>


<h3>Pi-Hole Configuration</h3>
<p>Okay, now go to <code>http://192.168.4.1/admin</code>, click the login button on the left sidebar, and login. This is web interface for Pi-hole.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>Once you're logged in, click on "settings" in the sidebar, and click on the DHCP tab. Check the box title "DHCP server enabled". You can ignore the red flashing warning; you don't have to do anything to your home router. Nothing on your home network will be affected. The Pi creates a little bubble that only affects computer connected to it. If you don't believe me, go to another computer connected to your home network, and trying logging in to Pi-hole. It won't work.</p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE]</p>
<p>At this point, you can start adding sites you want blocked. Click on the blacklist tab, and you should see a screen like below. When you add domains, one useful thing might be to add the domain, then add it again with that box "Add domain as wildcard" checked. This will prevent access to subdomains.</p>
