                <p>It has been a while since I hosted here. Honestly, its been a while since much of anything post-worthy has happened. I've been busy with school and my spring semester job, so the time of interesting side projects has been small. Not to mention a number of personal things... But the semester is slowing down, and I've been working on some new things.</p>
<h2>Ida</h2>
<p>First bit of news, my Lila language got renamed to Ida. There were personal reasons behind this, but also some more technical reasons, as well as based on future thoughts. I've kind of shelved the project for the time being.</p>
<p>For those of you who may be curious, here is why: I dove into compilers back in fall of 2019, and let me be clear, I <em>love</em> this field. However, I've been doing compiler project after compiler project almost constantly since this time, and I'm trying to find some different things to try my hand on. Additionally, I'm getting ready to start a job that will allow me to utilize my compiler knowledge, so I'm not sure how beneficial it will be for me to do compilers as a day job, then something else on the side. Maybe it is, but I want a different challenge to play with. Therefore, I'm shelving my compilers for the time being, and working on other projects, which I will publish in due time.</p>
<h2>CppEditor</h2>
<p>CppEditor got a few updates. Mainly it was some needed fixes, but I also added a feature where it will help you match opening and closing brackets/braces/etc for certain languages. For those of you who don't love this feature, you have the option of disabling.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>No, I'm not talking about programming languages. I'm talking about real languages. One of my goals for a long time has been to learn a foreign language. Because I have a light senior year, I'm going to try my hand at French. In the meantime, I'm trying to get a little bit of a start by learning and practicing some each day.</p>
<p>I'm also working on learning Esperanto. In the near future, I plan to write a more detailed post on Esperanto, but for those of you who don't know what it is, it is a constructed international auxiliary language. The grammar is extremely easy, and once you have that down, picking up the words is relatively straightforward, especially if your native language is a European language (which includes English). Learning Esperanto is supposed to help you once you learn another language, and besides, the ideas behind it are really cool.</p>
<h2>Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>I've been kind of on a self-improvement binge lately. Or maybe I shouldn't call it a binge, its more like a journey (because anyone who thinks it isn't clearly hasn't done it...). The main element to this is fitness, but I've also been trying a few other things like meditation. I've also been experimenting with some new daily schedules and planning tools. I'll have to write about some of this.</p>
<p>Keeping up with this site is one of my goals, and hopefully I'll be able to. Stay tuned!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I opened up four projects I had sitting around in private Github repositories. Except for "tiny-cpu", which I started this past weekend, all the others I initially started back in January. Originally, I wasn't going to make them public immediately, but I decided to do so (and got around to doing it yesterday).</p>
<h3>The Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>tiny-cpu</code>: I'm very interested in computer hardware and digital design, and I'm taking a class in computer architecture, so this is my first attempt at designing a simple CPU. At the time of writing, the register file, decoder, and part of the control unit are working. The CPU is written in VHDL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ada-asm</code>: This was part of another experiment. I really like Ada, and I wanted to see if I could generate structured binary files with it like in C. It turns out you can both easily and safely. The only thing interesting this does is generate a simple relocatable ELF, but hey that's pretty interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tsh</code>: A simple Unix shell I wrote to learn more about C and Linux processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>codepad</code>: A work-in-progress text editor I wrote to also learn C, but also to learn more about Gtk. It uses Gtk and GtkSourceView, and at the time of writing, it can do the basic new-open-save of a text editor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I Open Up Everything</h3>
<p>I've people comment on my Github profile and the amount of stuff on there. I mean, compared to some other people, its really not <em>that</em> much, but it is approaching 50 projects. And I also tend to make projects public well before they are useful. Why?</p>
<p>Four reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, most of these projects are for the sake of learning. Other than a few of my compiler/programming-language projects, none of them are anything super unique. If anything, its almost re-inventing the wheel. If you wish to become good at programming, I argue this is the best way to do so. Make a clone of an existing application, but at the same time make it at least somewhat useful. This has helped me so much, in some cases more than classes, and in other cases as extensions of classes.</p>
<p>Secondly, I like teaching others. I've used my projects in the past to show things to people, and they've often been helpful. When I say this, I don't mean like I'm some genius. There are many people much smarter than me out there. No, I mean this in the sense that I've figured out how to do something, and I want to share it with others who either have similar interests, or are also learning (or both).</p>
<p>Third, I believe that the best work (I'm speaking generally here) is done in an open environment. That is what Github is- an open environment (and this isn't meant to be a Github advertisement. I have a Gitlab account as well). If you publish your work in an environment like this, you can see what other people are working on and what ideas they've had, and apply it to your own. And because of the nature of open source, in many cases you can extend the ideas you find to your own. Or go back and contribute to them.</p>
<p>Finally, from a career perspective, having a Github profile like this is very, very helpful. I speak this out of experience, because its helped me a lot. Github acts as a second resume for me. It shows that I really love and am passionate about what I do. It also shows skill and what I know and am interested in.</p>
<h3>And That Said...</h3>
<p>If you're an aspiring developer, you should really consider doing this. Or even if you are a developer, open source is very much the way to go.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I spent a good part of today trying out different Linux distros on my lab machine, a Dell XPS desktop. Because I spent quite a bit of time on my computers (sometimes not entirely by choice...), when I need a change, switching my Linux distros is one of the best starting points. And even with that aside, knowing different distros is a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Linux Mint has consistently been my most used distro for the past six years. I tend to always come back to that. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, and has a very pretty, functional user interface. Its absolutely rock solid, and I like how the developers follow a "when-its-ready", but still regular enough release cycle.</p>
<p>However, I find that Linux Mint isn't always the best for development because the packages are often outdated. I mean, its usable for the vast majority of purposes, but there are times it becomes a real annoyance to me. For a while, I used Manjaro, which is also rather rock solid and very nice to use. It uses a rolling release cycle, which means you always have the latest packages. However, for reasons I will discuss below, I tend to use Fedora as my development distro. Fedora tends to have the latest packages, and is equally as rock solid and stable.</p>
<p>My Dell XPS, while being my lab machine, is also my archive and office machine. I have three drives, an M.2, an SSD, and a 1 TB regular hard drive. I really don't like using regular hard drives for development of any kind, and on second thoughts I didn't want to keep records and pictures on my laptop, so I use this to store stuff. The other two drives are development. So dual booting is an essential requirement (or is it tri-booting I guess...).</p>
<h3>OpenSUSE</h3>
<p>I've heard very good things about OpenSUSE, and I've used it a long time ago, though never in depth. I really wanted to try it, but I never got past the LiveCDs. One of them did boot and look really nice, but as a whole they gave me nothing but grief. The first time I tried it, it took <em>forever</em> to boot, and when it finally did, it was slow as hell. The other booted the first time, and looked rather nice, but for some reason never booted again.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I should have just installed it and tried it out, but the LiveCD experience was a significant turnoff.</p>
<h3>Solus</h3>
<p>Solus looks really, really nice. I like the Budgie desktop and the fact its rolling release. I did actually install it, only to find out that in EFI mode, it doesn't use Grub (and there's no option as far as I'm aware to enable it). I have a rule that Linux Mint is the booting distro, so if it doesn't work from Linux Mint, its out.</p>
<p>Its too bad. Solus looks very promising. Maybe I'll try it on my laptop...</p>
<h3>ElementaryOS</h3>
<p>I didn't do this on my desktop, but I installed it earlier in the week on my laptop. I have to say I really love this.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways its similar to Linux Mint in that its based on Ubuntu with its own desktop environment. As a result, it looks really nice and is stable and compatible with most stuff. The downsides are the same though: older packages. With ElementaryOS, I'm not sure of their release cycle yet, it follows the "when-ready" approach which I think is good, but it there doesn't seem to be a pattern. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully they get the Ubuntu 20 -based version before long.</p>
<p>ElementaryOS by design looks and feels like MacOS, which is a nice change for someone who generally lives by Windows-like interfaces.</p>
<h3>Manjaro</h3>
<p>I've used Manjaro many times in the past, and I <em>love</em> it. Its based on Arch Linux, and therefore follows the rolling-release model. Its seems more bleeding-edge than Solus, but I've never had any stability issues with it (at the same time though, I would never use it as my archive OS). I've never used it much on my desktop, but quite a lot on the laptop. Manjaro is really fast, and comes with the widest selection of desktops I've seen.</p>
<p>The problem is that it won't boot from the Linux Mint bootloader; it just hangs. At some point I may break down and just have to use it, but for now that is a sufficient annoyance for me not to use it.</p>
<h3>GhostBSD and FreeBSD</h3>
<p>I know, I know, this isn't Linux. I've always been intrigued with the other non-Unix systems, and BSD is no exception. The only problem is that I have yet to own a machine it actually works on.</p>
<p>When I say "actually works", its always booted and installed on the machines I've had, but there's always a network driver or graphics error that requires more sysadmin skills than I honestly have the patience for. At the end of the day, I'm programmer and like working with interesting problems, and sysadmin is neither. That's why I use these beginner distros like Linux Mint: they just work. I've actually had more luck with Solaris than the BSDs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This wasn't meant to be all negative. As you can see, two hits (Solus and ElementaryOS), two flops (*BSD and OpenSUSE), and one kind of both (Manjaro). For now I'm probably going to just stick to Fedora. I don't love how Fedora is a short-term point release, but its rock solid, everything works with it, and its recent enough to be a good development tool.</p>

                <p>I heard a while back from a friend that a Raspberry Pi can be used as a router. I never really thought about it until last December, when I was trying to find a more useful anti-distraction method than my browser blocker (it was too easy to get around). I found some guides on how you can use a Raspberry Pi to create a wireless access point within your home network, and from there install a DNS blackhole which can be used to block a lot of things.</p>
<p>I originally set things up and ran it on a Rasberry Pi 3B+, and it ran for the last 15 days or so of December. Then at the beginning of the year, I took it down and moved everything over to a Raspberry Pi 4. As of today, the Pi 4 has been happily running without a reboot for 28 days (which is now my personal record for the longest uptime of any computer).</p>
<p>Here's it running:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/rpi.jpg"></p>
<p>An anti-distraction mechanism? Doesn't that seem like an extreme method?</p>
<p>Yes. But its worth it. Even though I love what I do, its just too easy to get distracted when you're researching things. And it can become damaging if you let it happen unchecked too often. If you don't believe me, read <em>The Shallows</em> by Nicholas Carr.</p>
<p>But seriously though, its super easy to set up, even for a non-technical person, and it actually works. I can safely say this because system and network administration is not one of my strong points in computer science. The DNS blackhole I talked about is called Pi-Hole. Its actually used to block advertistements, but because of how it functions, its equally as well suited as a site blocker. And as far as speed goes, I really don't notice a difference from my home network. Downloads are slightly slower, but its not huge. Uploads aren't bad at all. I have Zoom meetings regularly with it, and again, no issues.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I have instructions on my site for setting it up: <a href="/howto/rpi-router.html">Raspberry Pi Router</a></p>

                <p>I drive a 2002 Ford Ranger, and I have been for over a year now (I bought it back in summer 2019). </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/ranger.jpg"></p>
<p>Rangers are great cars for people who like to drive trucks but don't want something huge. One of my few gripes with it was the radio system. It wasn't completely awful- it was actually an upgrade from my first car, a 2001 Ford Expedition (it was actually my dad's). Because of the Expedition, I've never been able to use my phone- I use CDs. But even though the Ranger can play more CDs, it struggles to actually play them.</p>
<p>So, for my birthday, I got an upgrade. And I tried to install it myself, and I got as far as getting the old one out:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="/images/radio-attempt.jpg"></p>
<p>Being the mechanical genius I am, it never occurred to me that you needed an adaptor for the connectors. I don't know, I thought they were all the same... But it turned out that Best Buy where my dad bought the radio had free installation, so I went there yesterday and had someone who knew what they were doing install it.</p>
<p>And its <em>awesome</em>. In addition to CDs and radio, it has Bluetooth, AUX plugin, and a USB charger. And because the radio was a little small, they used a mounting kit, so there's a little slot below, which will be nice for storing things... Just look below :)</p>
