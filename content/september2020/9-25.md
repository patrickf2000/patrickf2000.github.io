As much as I love programming, when one is on the computer all day for work and school, your desire to get off the computer begins to outweigh that. My parents have an old Samsung printer, but after many years of heavy use it began to jam when pulling up paper. It turns out the issue is this little part rather deep inside can get warn out and begin to stick, which is why it sucks up all that paper. When I say deep inside, I literally mean that. You have to take apart a lot to get to that issue. I should have taken a better shot, but here's what it looks like halfway through the process (that's the computer board).

It still doesn't work perfectly, put it can get through about 15 sheets before it jams. Oh well, that's fine, they never print more than maybe 5 at a time (and that's stretching it). 

I can't take credit for figuring it out, but I'm proud I got it fixed. Its always cool when you're able to fix something. If anyone has a Samsung SCX-4623FW jamming, here's an excellent link: [https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/](https://mypcjobs.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/samsung-scx-4623f-solenoid-issues/).
