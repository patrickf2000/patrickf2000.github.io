Title: Moving to Github

This post is actually a little overdue. I did this about a month ago, I just never had gotten around to writing it...

A few months ago, I wrote a post on my overall website structure. That since has changed. But for those who didn't see it, I will briefly cover it.

### In The Beginning...

I've been in and out of blogging for about a year and a half now. Originally, I created a Wordpress blog. I had to buy hosting from a company, and it really wasn't that expensive at the time. Fast forward a year later, I didn't feel like it had gotten anywhere, and when renewal came around, it was like double what it was originally. So yeah, couldn't afford that.

I looked at some other hosting providers, but then I read about static websites. I've known about those for a while, but I didn't know much about static site generators. A few similar blogs that I followed used them, and they looked really nice, so I decided to give it a try. There are several out there, but the one I use is called [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). Its really easy to use and configure, and there are plenty of themes. I actually really like how I can write my pages and posts in Markdown, and then just push it when I'm ready to publish.

For hosting, this site has actually moved around three times now. I originally used Surge (surge.sh), and it worked really well, but I didn't like how you had to upgrade to get HTTPS support. Also, when I installed surge on my Linux system, it dragged in a lot of crap. Pelican only uses Python, which I have anyway, so I don't mind that so much. After that, I moved it over to Gitlab. And then a month ago, I moved it to Github.

The reason for the second move was because the website is important to me, but the Gitlab account is not. I use Gitlab for smaller or half-finished projects that I don't really care about. All my important stuff is on Github, in part because I've used it for all my computer science jobs. I personally think getting Github to work is easier than surge or Gitlab.

### Setting Up Github

Github's website hosting is called Github Pages. To create a pages site, simply create a repository named `<your username>.github.io`:

The initial address of your site will be (in my case) "patrickf2000.github.io". Anything in the master branch will be hosted as the website.

I already had a custom domain that I wanted to use; the good news is that Github lets you do that as well. In my opinion, this is the hardest part. Github has better documentation than I could provide on the subject, but basically the gist is that you change it in the repository's settings, and then update the DNS settings for whoever your domain provider is.

For the curious, I use Namecheap for my domain name. As the name implies, its cheap... Yeah. I only pay like $10 yearly for it. Some of their names are cheaper than that.

### Publishing

The master branch cannot contain anything except the website- so in my case, the output of Pelican. Ideally though, you would want to store your sources, so there is two ways you can do that. The first is to create a separate repository; the second is to create a branch.

For my site, I have the master branch which has the site output, and a branch named `sources` which contains the Markdown and Pelican configuration. On my computer, I have two folders, one for each branch (you can do that...). In the sources folder, I write my post or update whatever, and then use a script to copy the output to the folder set on the master branch. It's really easy actually.

Here's the script; it will work on Linux and Mac OS. Windows users, you're on your own :)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

rm -rf ./output 
pelican content

rm -r ../patrickf2000.github.io/*
cp -r ./output/* ../patrickf2000.github.io
cp CNAME ../patrickf2000.github.io

cd ../patrickf2000.github.io
git add .
git commit
git push -u origin master

echo "Done"
```

If you want to automate the process even further, you can change the line that says `git commit` to something like `git commit -m "Post update"`. In my case, I actually care about commit messages, so this forces me to write one.

### Conclusion

As you can see, publishing a simple blog that still looks nice is really easy. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to get Google Analytics working so I can track page views. (I do care about privacy, but I also am curious if anyone actually looks at this). If you know how, let me know.

Finally, everything is public on Github, so feel free to look through the sources if you're curious about setting something similar up.
