Title: Vintage OS

So I was cleaning house earlier... Or rather, cleaning the computer. You know, when there gets to be a million things on your desktop? Anyway.

I have a small collection of vintage operating systems, some of which I've been able to get running in virtual machines. When I say vintage, I don't necessarily mean the ones everyone has heard about; there's a few obscure you may never have heard of. But anyway, I forgot I had screenshots of them because they are with the OSes and not the rest of my pictures. I only have three OSes photographed at the moment, but they are worth seeing.

## IBM OS/2

The only truly vintage one here. The history behind this operating system is interesting. It runs without any issues in Virtualbox, but as I remember it was a little tricky to get running. I lost the article, but if I ever decide to run it again, I'll be sure to post.

## Sky OS

Sky OS was a fairly complete operating system written mainly by Robert Szeleney from 1997 until 2009. It was a Unix-like OS with a graphical desktop, and even got to the point of being able to run real applications such as the GNU Toolchain and Firefox. The OS was meant to be a commerical product, but it never aquired a sufficient developer/user base, and eventually, Szeleney couldn't keep up with development. You can still find disk images and a key and boot it up in Virtualbox. Its a rather nice OS, its a shame it never went further.

## Syllable OS

Another free OS from the early 2000s. Unlike Sky OS, Syllable was actually open source. It eventually stagnated and development ended in 2012. There wasn't a huge team behind this one either, and it got really far in terms of capabilities. Its a shame neither this nor Sky OS ever became viable alternatives to Windows because they really had potential.
