I will be honest, I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, other than for like one or two songs. I think that's changing. On a completely unrelated search, I came across her new album, *Folklore*. I want to say its probably one of the best new albums I've heard in a while (other than Coldplay's *Everyday Life*, which is a close race). I think the overall feel is very appropriate for the times.

I was going through the songs on Youtube, and someone left a comment basically said "She wrote the whole album in quarantine, and I can't even finish a puzzle." Kind of a thought provoking honestly...

These are the best songs in my opinion:
