**Github**: @patrickf2000 (link above)   

### Experience

* *Research Assistant- UNC Charlotte*. Fall 2019-Present. Work includes writing a transformation for vectorizing loops on the AST level in the Rex OpenMP compiler; general help with Rex development; benchmarking the Intel AVX and Arm SVE extensions again different compilers using auto-vectorization techniques, vendor intrinsics, and assembly.

* *Student Intern- Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory*. June 2020-September 2020. Co-authoring a web- and container-based tool for performance analysis of applications using various tools.

* *Customer Service Team Member- Whole Foods Market*. May 2018- May 2020. Customer service team member; served various roles in this the department. I include this because you learn a lot of interpersonal skills in these jobs.

### Education

* *UNC Charlotte*: 2018-present   
BS in Computer Science (anticipated graduation in Spring 2022)   
Major: Computer science with software engineering concentration   
Minor: Computer engineering   
GPA: 3.57   

### Technical Skills

* Six years of experience with Linux and C++.

* *Programming Languages:* C++, Rust, C, Python, Haskell, Ada, Java (I have familiarity with many others as well)

* *Operating Systems:* Linux (I use it for everyday life and work); also familiar with FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows 10

* *Architectures (assembly):* x86-64, Arm64

* *Digital Systems:* Familiar with digital systems and their design, including binary and hexadecimal systems; digital logic; VHDL

### Projects

Note: These are unrelated to work. This is not all-inclusive.

* *Dash*: An imperative programming language inspired by Pascal; it is meant to be easy to learn, both on the language and compiler level, and easy to provide implementations and ports for. The compiler is written in Rust, and at time of writing, support for a custom assembler is being added to the x86 layer.

* *as*: A simple assembler for the x86-64 architecture. It generates code for the most common instructions in the ELF format, which can be linked as an executable or used with other libraries, including the C library.

* *Quik*: A simple imperative programming language inspired by C; it is meant to be easy to learn and use, and the compiler is designed to be easy to port and extend.

* *extcc*: A small C compiler meant to be easy to extend.

* *cparser*: A small proof-of-concept C parser written in Ada.

* *javac*: A library for generating Java bytecode.

* *quikvm*: A simple application virtual machine. There is a C++ and a Haskell implementation.

* *CppEditor*: A text/code editor inspired by the old Gedit. Supports syntax highlighting for most languages, a multi-document interface, and a project panel. Written in C++ using the Qt library and a few KDE libraries.

* *CppSheets*: A small spreadsheet application inspired by Microsoft Excel. Supports formatting, basic formulas, graphing, and uses a custom file format. Also some basic compatibility with MS Excel documents

* *CppMediaPlayer*: A simple media player; works with most audio and video formats.

* *webserver*: A small HTTP webserver.

* *Notepad*: A super simple Android note-taking application. Two years of testing on my phone :)

### Other Interests

* *Programming*: I find my work so interesting that it generally goes into my free time

* *Electronics*: Circuitry and digital design; the former with Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and the latter with VHDL

* *Radio-Control*: Member of the Po-Boys Proptwisters RC Airplane Club here in Charlotte, NC

* *Books*: I love reading

* *Writing*: See the blog
