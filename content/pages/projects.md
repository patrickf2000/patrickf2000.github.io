Title: Projects

Welcome to my projects page! Although most of what I do is software-related, I do enjoy doing projects in other areas. Most of it is technology related, but some isn't. This page contains links to things like documentation, tutorials, and some other stuff.

For the smaller tutorials and articles on various things, please see the blog. The tutorials I have here are for more substantial projects that may be too long for a blog. They are also here so I can easily reference them.

### Software

I do a lot of software projects:

* [This page](/software-projects.html) contains a general overview of the majority of my screenshots.
* [Ida Compiler](ida-log.html) was a fairly recent project I worked on for about three months.

### Tutorials

* [Raspberry Pi Router](/howto/rpi-router.html)
* [Installing Pi-Hole](/howto/pihole-install.html)
* [Arm-64 Linux on Qemu](/arm64-on-qemu.html)

### Other

I really like photography and writing. This website is meant to be the main source of that, but I have been (without the greatest of success) trying to do some Medium writing. For the photography, I uploaded some of my pictures to Flickr; I hope to upload some more later.

* My [Medium Profile](https://medium.com/@patrickf2000) where you can find my more in-depth writing.
* My [Flickr Profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/patrickf2000/) where you can find some of my photos.
* [A Simple Constructed Language](/pages/conlang1.html)
