title: Contact Me

Want to contact me? Awesome, I always enjoy hearing from people. There are a few ways you can do it.

For professional reasons, you can do so on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-flynn4664/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-flynn4664/)

For everything else, you are welcome to contact me at this email address: [pflynn4664@pm.me](mailto:pflynn4664@pm.me).

There are a few things I would like to respectfully ask:

- Do not contact me about improving my site and things like SEO optimization. The answer is no. This is a hobby project, I use Github pages and a site generator.   
- Do not contact me about surveys, marketing, or "entrepreneurial experiences" (aka, free work). Like really, just don't.   
- Contract Work: This is not a hard no, but the answer is very probably not. I would only be open to something if not much else is going on, and the best way to find out is to look at my LinkedIn profile   

I don't mean to come off as a jerk, but really, I have had this happen multiple times and its annoying. That said, these are the kind of things I'm open to:

- Anything relating to my projects on Github.   
- Project contributions   
- Worthwhile professional-related things (please use LinkedIn for this)   
- Interesting things   

Regarding projects on Github, under the license you don't have to ask me to do anything with them, but if you want to fork them off, I'd be interested in knowing- just drop me an email.
