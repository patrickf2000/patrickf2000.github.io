Title: Contact Me

If you want to get in touch with me for a professional reason, I ask that you connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-flynn4664/) so I can see who you are. For the most part, I accept any connection requests. If you want to see my resume, I ask that you use LinkedIn so I can see who you are.

For anything else, you can email me at [pflynn4664@pm.me](mailto:pflynn4664@pm.me). A few things I ask however (I put these because I've had this happen):

* This site is a hobby project. I am not interested in adding things like SEO optimization, better themes, or anything like that.
* I don't do free work. Don't ask me to do "entrepreneurial opportunities".
* At the moment, I'm not available to do contact work.

Going off the last point, while I'm not available to do contract work, if you are interested in using one of my projects in yours, I am happy to help guide you through it. If you want to contribute to any, that's always welcome as well.
