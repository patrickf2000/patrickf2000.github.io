Title: Site Reboot

One of my summer projects is to transform this site into a more serious blog. This started as a school project a year or so ago, and eventually became my online resume/portfolio, with some low-grade blogging. However, I want to up things a little bit, so I'm going to take this version of the site down and replace it with something else within the next month or so (hopefully the next few weeks).

The URL and much of the content other than the blog will still be the same. However, the existing blog posts will go (I may recycle some of the better ones, however). There are a few reasons behind this decision.

First is the reason I mentioned above. Secondly, I want to change to a more serious hosting provider so I can have access to more things such as a better blogging system, webmail, and FTP. Github pages is good for what its worth, but it doesn't give you much. Finally, I started this site and mostly maintained it through mid-summer into last fall and winter of 2020, which is time I want to forget. This site as it is right now is beginning to represent that time period to me.

This site will still be live until I'm ready, except for a possible blackout while the domain transfers. Keep an eye out for the change, and I hope to see you on the new version!
