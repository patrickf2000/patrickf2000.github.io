… until the internet goes down. Okay, maybe in ordinary times it wouldn’t be so bad, but in covid-19 days, its a different story. 

The internet is a constant frustration around here for us. We live out, though not technically in the country. Its more like the outer-outer suburbs of Charlotte, in one of the newly-developing areas. You think that in an area that’s almost all new-construction, the internet would be built to work properly. Not so. We have brief dips several times a week, we usually have to restart the router every couple weeks or so, and every now and then, it will give up, crash, and go out completely. 

It sometimes frustrates me how dependent we have become on the internet in such a short time, especially for our jobs. I’m not necessarily against it, but more often than not, I think we are over-dependent. In recent months to curb time I spend (or I should say, waste) online, I’ve been making a point to download and save things like technical documents to my computers so when I program, I can just reference those rather than going on Google binge. This is all well and good for some projects, but when you have a job that is a web application using remote resources, its a different story.

Okay enough ranting.
