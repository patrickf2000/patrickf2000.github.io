Hello everyone!

So I decided I'm going to give blogging a try... Make that my social media I guess. I've tried it before, but things never really took off- I think I was trying too hard. Not to mention that blogs can be expensive. I got around that by using Pelican to generate my blog, and surge.sh to host the site. All this for free. All I paid for is the domain which I think was like $10. Anyway, I'm going to make this like a journal, then maybe I'll actually write.

I am rare among people of my generation because I don't use social media. And to add further irony, I am a computer scientist, and enjoy programming in my free time. Yeah, strange. Okay, I actually did have social media for a brief period, but I never could get into it. I got into it more, it made my life miserable, and I deleted all of it three months later. I'll have to write more about this another time. I kind of want this blog to replace that.

We'll see how it goes... Even if its a journal I can look back upon I'll be happy with it.
