                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Patrick Flynn; I am a computer science student and research assistant at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. This is my personal corner of the internet where I some professional information and post things that I find interesting (which are mainly technical).</p>
<p>My computer interests lie in compilers, programming languages, computer architecture, and high-performance computing. However, I have experimented with some other areas as well. I've written desktop applications, a few Android apps, a simple chat application, and a few other things. Although a lot of what I do is computer related, I also enjoy tinkering with electronics, flying radio control airplanes, reading, writing, and when I can, exploring.</p>
<p>To see my resume, check out my LinkedIn profile (see the contact page), or view it right here: <a href="pages/resume.html">Resume</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a page with some detailed information (not all inclusive): <a href="pages/projects.html">Projects</a>.</p>
<p>And last but not least, my favorite quote. You could say this is my personal motto when I work on things.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>This site is a free-time project, and I primarily write about technical matters on the blog (although I may write about other things that interest me). The opinions are my own and do not reflect any employer past, present, or future. Any projects on my personal Github page are my own; I do use my Github profile for work, but these are clearly delineated.</p>
<h4>Tracking</h4>
<p>I believe in privacy, so the most information I collect from this site is page views (which I'm still trying to get working...). This is a static website- I use Pelican to generate content- so really, don't worry about anything. If you don't trust me, its all on Github.</p>
