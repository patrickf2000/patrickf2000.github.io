<p>VHDL has been a fun new toy for me :) . I find how computers work down on the hardware level really interesting- meaning the underlying logic by which they do operations. This is part of the reason I got into compilers. I love seeing how programming constructs translate into CPU instructions, and then how the CPU instructions are translated into logical operations (or rather, the logic behind these operations).</p>
<p>Integer math and bitwise operations are some of the most fundamental instructions to a computer. While modern CPU's can do tons of different operations, the most commonly used instructions are data moves, jumps, and the integer operations. The x86 instruction set is huge, but the majority of programs only use around 15-20 of them (if you don't count the different variants, its really like 10-15). Of these 10-15 instructions, probably about two thirds of them are in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Because I find binary math interesting, I decided to try making one in VHDL.</p>
<p>I'm not going to describe my actually code here, I'm just going to go into the theory behind it. If you want to see some code, take a look at my "simple-alu" project on Github.</p>
<p>An ALU is actually quite simple. The ALU I built works with 8-bit signed integers, and can do addition, subtraction, 2's complement, and/or/xor/not, increments, and decrements. Much of the ALU is built around the adder circuit. I wrote about my 8-bit adder in a fairly recent post; I reused the code here. Once you have that piece done, you can do the rest pretty easily.</p>
<p>An adder in the sense I talk about here is a sequence of full adders, which work on two bits and return a sum and a carry. A full adder takes the exclusive-or (xor) of inputs A and B, xor's that with a carry-in, which produces the sum. The carry-out is ((a xor b) and carry-in) or'ed with (a and b). To work with numbers larger than one bit, you simply use a bunch of these full adders, with the carry-out connected to the carry-in of the next adder in the sequence (in the case of the first adder, the carry-in is set to 0). You can use the same adder circuit for signed and unsigned numbers.</p>
<p>As I said, much of the ALU is built around the adder. Once you have the adder done, you can do addition, subtraction, 2's complement, increments, and decrements. The and/xor/xor/not gates are simply that operation applied to each bit of the input (the not gate only requires one input, as it just flips the bits of each input). I won't cover those here, as that should be pretty easy to understand. Let's move on to the other components.</p>
<p>In order to understand the other operations, you must understand how negative or signed numbers are represented in binary. A negative number is represented as the 2's complement of the absolute value (or the positive number). To find the 2's complement, you invert all the bits of the original number and add 1. So for 3, the binary in four bits is 0011. You probably know that in binary, each digit corresponds to a power of 2, starting with 2 ^ 0 on the far right. So for our binary number above, to convert to decimal, you add 2 ^ 0 + 2 ^ 1 = 3 (you ignore the first two digits because they are zero). To get -3, invert the bits- so 1100- and add 1- so 1101. How do we know this equals -3? Use the same conversion method as above; however, the number to the far left (the most significant bit) is negative two raised to whatever power. So -2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 0, which equals -8 + 4 + 1, which equals -3. Kind of cool right? In case you're wondering, you know that the number is negative because the MSB equals 1.</p>
<p>Now that we understand 2's complement, we can finish the other operations. First, the 2's complement unit. This unit is super simple. You can use the 8-bit NOT unit to flip all the bits, and then add 1 to it using our adder. All done.</p>
<p>Now for the subtractor. Computers don't have the concept of subtraction in the way you might think of it. Consider 5 - 3. The answer is 2. Now, think of it as an addition operation with negative numbers. The problem becomes 5 + (-3). What's the answer? Still 2. This is how computers do subtraction. They negate the second number, and add it to the first. Let's do this in binary. 5 in binary is 0101. 3 is 0011. 3 negated (or -3) is 1101. Let's add it together: 0101 + 1101. The answer is 0010 with a carry of 1. However, because we are dealing with 4-bit numbers, we can drop the carry, leaving us only with 0010. What's that in decimal? 2 ^ 1 (for the second digit place) = 2, so our answer is correct.</p>
<p>So the subtractor unit simply uses the 2's complement unit to negate the second input, and then adds that result to the first input, which yields our result.</p>
<p>After that, we only have the increment and decrement units left. These only take one input, and internally use the adder and subtractor units hardwired with 1 to calculate the result. </p>
<p>The only two components left at the moment are the left and right shifters. I have a high-level understanding of how those work, but not enough to generate the VHDL code. I honestly think these are the most complex components in the circuit. I may write about them once I get them implemented.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering how the ALU decides which operation to perform. An ALU takes two integer inputs and an opcode input. The opcode decides the operation, and the opcode is decoded using a multiplexer. I'll probably reserve a more detailed discussion on multiplexers for later when I can draw a diagram, but for now here's a hopefully somewhat clear explanation of how it works in our case.</p>
<p>A multiplexer takes several inputs, and based on the value of one or more selector inputs, produces a single output (which is one of the inputs). Our ALU has a 4-bit selector input, meaning that we can choose from 16 inputs (in reality, I think I only use 12). The two numerical inputs of the ALU are connected to each of the ALU's operations. Depending on the opcode, the result of that operation is the one allowed to move through the bus to the output. Basically, all the operations are computed once the ALU is invoked, but depending on the opcode, only one of the results is allowed through the bus into the output.</p>
<p>That concludes our walk-though on a basic integer ALU. Other than the left and right shifts, I'm not sure if I'll do much more to this project. I am thinking about drawing out a schematic for it, maybe even building it. I'll write if I do.</p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="/category/programming.html">Programming</a>

<p>As part of one of my classes I'm taking this semester, I'm learning about VHDL. Actually, I think VHDL is the optional part (so far, I've been learning it pretty much on my own, though the introduction came from the class). I've wanted to learn a hardware descriptor language for â€¦</p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="/category/programming.html">Programming</a>
