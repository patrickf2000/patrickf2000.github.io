                <p>Once again it's been a while… I didn’t realize I had let my blog go through May without an update. Oh well. It's been busy the past month with life and personal stuff, some of which I’ll share.</p>
<h3>Another School Year…</h3>
<p>Another school year has come and gone. I just finished my junior year, which means I have only one more year left of undergraduate. I think I could have finished a semester early, but I wanted to focus on my internship, and there really isn’t a need. I need some extra credits anyway, so I decided to enroll in French 1 and 2 for my final year.</p>
<p>It’s kind of surreal in a way to be done with yet another year. And to make it even more surreal, almost half my college time has been online thanks to covid (online degree… lol). Academically it’s been nice- as far as grades go, this has been my best year. Everything is coming back to normal, which I’m looking forward to.</p>
<h3>A New Job</h3>
<p>If you’ve seen my resume, last year I worked for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I really enjoyed the whole lab experience, so I decided to do the same again this year. However, for various reasons, I switched labs, this time going to the Los Alamos National Laboratory (yep, the place where they built the atomic bomb). It’s only week three, but so far it’s been an enjoyable experience. I am doing some work on the LANL fork of Clang/LLVM, which is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Like anyone in the compiler field, I’ve been familar with LLVM, but being the type of person that likes to torture myself (using a very good friend’s words here), I always wrote my compilers completely from scratch- frontend and backend. And I do really like writing backends. However, after working with LLVM, I want to say it’s so awesome.</p>
<h3>New Projects</h3>
<p>Because I haven’t received the covid vaccine yet, I still have sufficient time to do some fun side projects. In the past few months, I’ve been making an effort to break out of the programming space and explore other areas. Don’t get me wrong, I love programming, but it's good and healthy to have a variety of hobbies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have started on yet another compiler project. It's not public yet since it's in the early stages, but it is past that initial point where it will either become a project or get abandoned. It’s a new compiler written in C++ to help me learn LLVM, partly for my job and partly because I really like it. At the moment, it’s a rewrite of the Ida compiler I spent the tail end of last year working on. So far, it’s going really well. I still wrote the frontend from scratch, and I would like to say it has my best expression parser yet.</p>
<p>As for my non-programming projects, my main things have been reading, languages, and some writing. The reading honestly has been self-help stuff lately, but still, it’s been good reading. I’ll come back to that in another post. The languages have taken two forms. Because I’m taking French this fall, I’ve been working to get a start on that over the summer. It's been really enjoyable. Learning Esperanto at the beginning of the year was helpful. The second form, being the nerd that I am, I’ve been exploring constructed languages. I created a simple one, and I’m working on the second version now. Finally, with writing, I’m still trying to keep this site up, and I started doing some creative writing as well.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have some outlines down for more things to write about, so hopefully I’ll be able to keep this site up through the coming months. There will still be plenty of tech, but I will probably start branching out into other areas. Stay tuned!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Time to switch gears here! Today I'm going to drift out of the technology area into a more personal area.</p>
<p>As tough as 2020 was, it was good in that the lockdowns, and "forced winters" (I forget where I saw this term...) were really self-revealing. For me, fall 2020 especially was so, largely due to do some personal issues. Because it seemed likely that the whole covid situation would continue at least through the first half of 2021, even with the vaccines, I wanted to use the remaining time to really make some improvements.</p>
<p>I've never really liked the whole "New Year Resolution" thing. Basically, it means setting a difficult if not unattainable goal at one of the busiest times of year and carrying it for a few weeks before you bomb out and feel bad about yourself. Near the end of 2020, I stumbled across a Reddit post where someone addressed this very thing. I took a slight twist on it, which I would like to share.</p>
<p>Also, before I get into it, this isn't something you have to wait till next year to do. You can start at any point, and you can adjust as needed. The reason I'm sharing is I wanted to make sure I would stay with it, and I have for almost four months now (a quarter of year), so I think it's safe to share.</p>
<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>The idea is simple. You pick one thing you want to address- whether a habit you want to form or break- and then work on that habit for one month. Each month of the year will have a specific habit. My twist on this is not to focus on one specific thing, but to choose a category of a few very inter-related things. Granted, it depends on what you're trying to do- some months it may be better to do only one thing- but I think its slightly counter-productive to do only one thing.</p>
<p>To keep track, I use a journal; at the beginning of each month, I set up a table and just put a check when if I have accomplished the goal.</p>
<h3>What Should I Choose?</h3>
<p>Good question. Actually, you may be thinking "oh one for each month? That's easy!". Maybe, but I found its actually not. There's 12 months. When you start writing it all down, you may be having some trouble as you get near the end of the year.</p>
<p>I'm not going to say what you should and shouldn't choose, but I will say for the first month to pick something easy- something you are already doing and just want to make a permanent habit. That way, it will make this stick and make it easier for you tackle and track harder goals in the coming months. For example, in January I chose "Sleep and Hygiene". Obviously, I was already doing this, but my bed and wake-up times were kind of all over the place, as were some hygiene habits. I just wanted to solidify this.</p>
<p>I won't go into great detail for obvious reasons, but here are my goals as of right now (past/present):</p>
<ul>
<li>January- Sleep &amp; Hygiene</li>
<li>February- Order (Make sure place is cleaned up &amp; next day planned)</li>
<li>March- Technology (didn't work out- see next section) -&gt; Became exercise</li>
<li>April- Mental Health 1</li>
<li>May- Mental Health 2</li>
<li>June- Work/life balance</li>
<li>July- Deep Work</li>
<li>August- Personal</li>
<li>September/October- Social (slight differences)</li>
<li>November- gave myself two options</li>
<li>December- Reading</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addressing Fluidity</h3>
<p>Despite your best intentions, things might not work out one month, or you may look at a goal and be like "why did I choose X for month Y???".</p>
<p>Going back to my list above: January and February worked out really well- those habits have stuck for the most part. March was meant to be focusing on addressing some of my tech problems that everyone else probably also has (no offense :) ), but it didn't work out for mainly practical reasons. Additionally, April was meant to be focused on exercise, but I actually started that in late February, so March actually became more about the exercise even though I didn't track it.</p>
<p>Near the end of March, I re-arranged everything. And its okay to do that, I feel if anything it has added to the overall experience. The circumstances were different near the end of March when I re-arranged than back in January when I first planned this. And like I said, March ended up being a stressful month, and the goal I chose, while something I want to address, was not attainable at that time.</p>
<h3>Does it Work?</h3>
<p>I think it does. The whole idea behind this is to still challenge yourself, but still make easy and practical enough that you can do it. Have you ever heard of SMART goals? It stands for "Specific", "Measurable", "Achievable", "Relevant", and "Time Bound". Let us go through this. I'm going to use exercise as an example.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific-&gt; If I just wrote "exercise", what does that mean? A walk? The gym? Be specific. For me, this meant a daily run.</li>
<li>Achievable-&gt; If I wrote "go to the gym", I would have failed. There are no gyms near me, and besides with covid, even if they are not locked down, its probably not the best time to be going. However, the neighborhood I live in is big enough to get a decent run in (I measured 4 miles with two laps), and it only takes 30-40 minutes. That is an achievable goal.</li>
<li>Relevant-&gt; The "Why". Why am I doing this? I sit on my ass in front of a computer most of the day, which isn't overly healthy physically or mentally.</li>
<li>Time-bound-&gt; I don't think I have to explain this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will say when you start this, you will actually be forcing yourself into two habits: the habits you chose for that month, and the habit of actually keeping track. The best advice I can give is put the table in a place where you will remember to record it. In my case, the journal worked really well. Recently I've switched to a digital tracker, but I'll save that for another post.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you've been wanting to make some improvements, I encourage you to try this method. There's no one right way, and I've found it to be very motivating.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>It has been a while since I hosted here. Honestly, its been a while since much of anything post-worthy has happened. I've been busy with school and my spring semester job, so the time of interesting side projects has been small. Not to mention a number of personal things... But the semester is slowing down, and I've been working on some new things.</p>
<h2>Ida</h2>
<p>First bit of news, my Lila language got renamed to Ida. There were personal reasons behind this, but also some more technical reasons, as well as based on future thoughts. I've kind of shelved the project for the time being.</p>
<p>For those of you who may be curious, here is why: I dove into compilers back in fall of 2019, and let me be clear, I <em>love</em> this field. However, I've been doing compiler project after compiler project almost constantly since this time, and I'm trying to find some different things to try my hand on. Additionally, I'm getting ready to start a job that will allow me to utilize my compiler knowledge, so I'm not sure how beneficial it will be for me to do compilers as a day job, then something else on the side. Maybe it is, but I want a different challenge to play with. Therefore, I'm shelving my compilers for the time being, and working on other projects, which I will publish in due time.</p>
<h2>CppEditor</h2>
<p>CppEditor got a few updates. Mainly it was some needed fixes, but I also added a feature where it will help you match opening and closing brackets/braces/etc for certain languages. For those of you who don't love this feature, you have the option of disabling.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>No, I'm not talking about programming languages. I'm talking about real languages. One of my goals for a long time has been to learn a foreign language. Because I have a light senior year, I'm going to try my hand at French. In the meantime, I'm trying to get a little bit of a start by learning and practicing some each day.</p>
<p>I'm also working on learning Esperanto. In the near future, I plan to write a more detailed post on Esperanto, but for those of you who don't know what it is, it is a constructed international auxiliary language. The grammar is extremely easy, and once you have that down, picking up the words is relatively straightforward, especially if your native language is a European language (which includes English). Learning Esperanto is supposed to help you once you learn another language, and besides, the ideas behind it are really cool.</p>
<h2>Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>I've been kind of on a self-improvement binge lately. Or maybe I shouldn't call it a binge, its more like a journey (because anyone who thinks it isn't clearly hasn't done it...). The main element to this is fitness, but I've also been trying a few other things like meditation. I've also been experimenting with some new daily schedules and planning tools. I'll have to write about some of this.</p>
<p>Keeping up with this site is one of my goals, and hopefully I'll be able to. Stay tuned!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I opened up four projects I had sitting around in private Github repositories. Except for "tiny-cpu", which I started this past weekend, all the others I initially started back in January. Originally, I wasn't going to make them public immediately, but I decided to do so (and got around to doing it yesterday).</p>
<h3>The Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>tiny-cpu</code>: I'm very interested in computer hardware and digital design, and I'm taking a class in computer architecture, so this is my first attempt at designing a simple CPU. At the time of writing, the register file, decoder, and part of the control unit are working. The CPU is written in VHDL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ada-asm</code>: This was part of another experiment. I really like Ada, and I wanted to see if I could generate structured binary files with it like in C. It turns out you can both easily and safely. The only thing interesting this does is generate a simple relocatable ELF, but hey that's pretty interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tsh</code>: A simple Unix shell I wrote to learn more about C and Linux processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>codepad</code>: A work-in-progress text editor I wrote to also learn C, but also to learn more about Gtk. It uses Gtk and GtkSourceView, and at the time of writing, it can do the basic new-open-save of a text editor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I Open Up Everything</h3>
<p>I've people comment on my Github profile and the amount of stuff on there. I mean, compared to some other people, its really not <em>that</em> much, but it is approaching 50 projects. And I also tend to make projects public well before they are useful. Why?</p>
<p>Four reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, most of these projects are for the sake of learning. Other than a few of my compiler/programming-language projects, none of them are anything super unique. If anything, its almost re-inventing the wheel. If you wish to become good at programming, I argue this is the best way to do so. Make a clone of an existing application, but at the same time make it at least somewhat useful. This has helped me so much, in some cases more than classes, and in other cases as extensions of classes.</p>
<p>Secondly, I like teaching others. I've used my projects in the past to show things to people, and they've often been helpful. When I say this, I don't mean like I'm some genius. There are many people much smarter than me out there. No, I mean this in the sense that I've figured out how to do something, and I want to share it with others who either have similar interests, or are also learning (or both).</p>
<p>Third, I believe that the best work (I'm speaking generally here) is done in an open environment. That is what Github is- an open environment (and this isn't meant to be a Github advertisement. I have a Gitlab account as well). If you publish your work in an environment like this, you can see what other people are working on and what ideas they've had, and apply it to your own. And because of the nature of open source, in many cases you can extend the ideas you find to your own. Or go back and contribute to them.</p>
<p>Finally, from a career perspective, having a Github profile like this is very, very helpful. I speak this out of experience, because its helped me a lot. Github acts as a second resume for me. It shows that I really love and am passionate about what I do. It also shows skill and what I know and am interested in.</p>
<h3>And That Said...</h3>
<p>If you're an aspiring developer, you should really consider doing this. Or even if you are a developer, open source is very much the way to go.</p>

                    <a href="/journey-through-distro-land.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Journey Through Distro Land&quot;">Journey Through Distro Land</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I spent a good part of today trying out different Linux distros on my lab machine, a Dell XPS desktop. Because I spent quite a bit of time on my computers (sometimes not entirely by choice...), when I need a change, switching my Linux distros is one of the best starting points. And even with that aside, knowing different distros is a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Linux Mint has consistently been my most used distro for the past six years. I tend to always come back to that. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, and has a very pretty, functional user interface. Its absolutely rock solid, and I like how the developers follow a "when-its-ready", but still regular enough release cycle.</p>
<p>However, I find that Linux Mint isn't always the best for development because the packages are often outdated. I mean, its usable for the vast majority of purposes, but there are times it becomes a real annoyance to me. For a while, I used Manjaro, which is also rather rock solid and very nice to use. It uses a rolling release cycle, which means you always have the latest packages. However, for reasons I will discuss below, I tend to use Fedora as my development distro. Fedora tends to have the latest packages, and is equally as rock solid and stable.</p>
<p>My Dell XPS, while being my lab machine, is also my archive and office machine. I have three drives, an M.2, an SSD, and a 1 TB regular hard drive. I really don't like using regular hard drives for development of any kind, and on second thoughts I didn't want to keep records and pictures on my laptop, so I use this to store stuff. The other two drives are development. So dual booting is an essential requirement (or is it tri-booting I guess...).</p>
<h3>OpenSUSE</h3>
<p>I've heard very good things about OpenSUSE, and I've used it a long time ago, though never in depth. I really wanted to try it, but I never got past the LiveCDs. One of them did boot and look really nice, but as a whole they gave me nothing but grief. The first time I tried it, it took <em>forever</em> to boot, and when it finally did, it was slow as hell. The other booted the first time, and looked rather nice, but for some reason never booted again.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe I should have just installed it and tried it out, but the LiveCD experience was a significant turnoff.</p>
<h3>Solus</h3>
<p>Solus looks really, really nice. I like the Budgie desktop and the fact its rolling release. I did actually install it, only to find out that in EFI mode, it doesn't use Grub (and there's no option as far as I'm aware to enable it). I have a rule that Linux Mint is the booting distro, so if it doesn't work from Linux Mint, its out.</p>
<p>Its too bad. Solus looks very promising. Maybe I'll try it on my laptop...</p>
<h3>ElementaryOS</h3>
<p>I didn't do this on my desktop, but I installed it earlier in the week on my laptop. I have to say I really love this.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways its similar to Linux Mint in that its based on Ubuntu with its own desktop environment. As a result, it looks really nice and is stable and compatible with most stuff. The downsides are the same though: older packages. With ElementaryOS, I'm not sure of their release cycle yet, it follows the "when-ready" approach which I think is good, but it there doesn't seem to be a pattern. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully they get the Ubuntu 20 -based version before long.</p>
<p>ElementaryOS by design looks and feels like MacOS, which is a nice change for someone who generally lives by Windows-like interfaces.</p>
<h3>Manjaro</h3>
<p>I've used Manjaro many times in the past, and I <em>love</em> it. Its based on Arch Linux, and therefore follows the rolling-release model. Its seems more bleeding-edge than Solus, but I've never had any stability issues with it (at the same time though, I would never use it as my archive OS). I've never used it much on my desktop, but quite a lot on the laptop. Manjaro is really fast, and comes with the widest selection of desktops I've seen.</p>
<p>The problem is that it won't boot from the Linux Mint bootloader; it just hangs. At some point I may break down and just have to use it, but for now that is a sufficient annoyance for me not to use it.</p>
<h3>GhostBSD and FreeBSD</h3>
<p>I know, I know, this isn't Linux. I've always been intrigued with the other non-Unix systems, and BSD is no exception. The only problem is that I have yet to own a machine it actually works on.</p>
<p>When I say "actually works", its always booted and installed on the machines I've had, but there's always a network driver or graphics error that requires more sysadmin skills than I honestly have the patience for. At the end of the day, I'm programmer and like working with interesting problems, and sysadmin is neither. That's why I use these beginner distros like Linux Mint: they just work. I've actually had more luck with Solaris than the BSDs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This wasn't meant to be all negative. As you can see, two hits (Solus and ElementaryOS), two flops (*BSD and OpenSUSE), and one kind of both (Manjaro). For now I'm probably going to just stick to Fedora. I don't love how Fedora is a short-term point release, but its rock solid, everything works with it, and its recent enough to be a good development tool.</p>
