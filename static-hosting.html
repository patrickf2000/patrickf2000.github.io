    <p>Static sites are somewhat of a new thing for me. I wrote about this a little bit a few weeks ago, but I'm going to write more primarily as guidance for others interested in inexpensive blogging.</p>
<p>Back when I was originally trying to blog, I was using Wordpress (like everyone else...). Don't get me wrong, I love Wordpress, but the reason I stopped was money. I originally had hosting for my first year, but when it renewed it went up a lot from what it originally was. Now granted, it was probably my fault since I'm sure it was spelled out and I just didn't read it. Regardless, it pretty much came down to paying a lot for decent hosting or cheaping out and hopefully getting something decent- if I wanted to keep Wordpress.</p>
<p>That's why I'm now doing static hosting. I'm using Pelican as my content generator, and its actually quite nice once you learn how to use it. Hosting was more of a challenge. Originally, I was using surge.sh, which is really nice until it you get to custom domains. Custom domains are free, but HTTPS is not. I tried it, but my wake-up call came yesterday when I switched desktop computers and Firefox gave me all kind of certificate warnings about the site which rightly would scare people off. So, I decided to switch.</p>
<p>A slight downside to static blogging is unlike Wordpress, you are responsible for the posts and making sure they get backed up and saved. Using Git is a really good solution for this. Not that it matters, I kind of preferred to keep this stuff in a private repository, which meant I kept it on Gitlab (I have Github and Gitlab accounts- Github for the important public stuff, and Gitlab for my smaller private stuff). This is where the static hosting comes in. Github and Gitlab both have a static site feature- basically, you can create a free static site based from your repository. I've personally found Gitlab to be a lot nicer. You can create your website from a private repository and it seems to offer a higher level of configuration (all based on the free plan by the way). Now granted, I didn't look into Github much deeper after I noticed you can create the site from a private repo in Gitlab, but you cannot in Github. Setup was really easy, as was pointing my custom domain to it.</p>
<p>Even if you're not overly technical, learning just enough Git to do this is easy. If you are, it should be no trouble at all. As far as cost goes- which is a big benefit to static hosting- all I paid for was my domain name which was like $10 I think. If you're a blogger on a budget, this is something to think about.</p>
